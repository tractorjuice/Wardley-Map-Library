# <a id="chapter-1-the-dual-nature-of-ai-in-esg"></a>Chapter 1: The Dual Nature of AI in ESG

## <a id="environmental-impact"></a>Environmental Impact

### <a id="energy-consumption-of-ai-systems"></a>Energy Consumption of AI Systems

The environmental impact of artificial intelligence systems presents one of the most significant paradoxes in the ESG landscape. While AI promises to revolutionise sustainability efforts, its own energy footprint raises serious concerns about its net environmental benefit. As we delve into this critical aspect of AI's dual nature, we must examine both the direct and indirect energy implications of deploying AI systems at scale.

> Training a single large language model can consume as much energy as five cars over their entire lifetime, including their manufacturing process. We must carefully weigh these environmental costs against the potential benefits.

The energy consumption of AI systems can be broadly categorised into three primary phases: training, inference, and infrastructure maintenance. The training phase, particularly for large models, represents the most energy-intensive period, often requiring massive computational resources over extended periods. The inference phase, while less intensive per instance, accumulates significant energy costs through repeated use across millions of applications.

- Model Training Energy Costs: Including data preparation, algorithm development, and multiple training iterations
- Inference and Deployment Impact: Ongoing energy consumption from model deployment and real-world application
- Infrastructure Requirements: Energy needed for cooling systems, data centres, and supporting hardware
- Hidden Environmental Costs: Manufacturing of specialised AI hardware and disposal of obsolete equipment

The geographical location of AI infrastructure significantly influences its environmental impact. Data centres positioned in regions powered predominantly by renewable energy sources naturally have a lower carbon footprint compared to those reliant on fossil fuels. This geographical disparity creates an additional layer of complexity when assessing the true environmental cost of AI systems.

> Our research indicates that relocating AI training operations to regions with predominantly renewable energy sources can reduce the carbon footprint by up to 80% compared to traditional locations, according to a prominent environmental technology researcher.

>![Draft Wardley Map: [Wardley Map showing the evolution of AI energy consumption patterns and their relationship to environmental impact]](https://images.wardleymaps.ai/map_ec62eff6-e815-4497-b6ed-5b7c5740621f.png)
