## Map Overview

A comprehensive map showing the value chain from Sustainable Development Goals down to operational elements required for AI implementation

**Anchor:** Sustainable Development Goals serves as the anchor, representing the ultimate purpose of the system and driving all downstream activities and value creation

## Component Analysis

### Sustainable Development Goals

- **Position:** High visibility, high maturity (0.95, 0.89)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+Utility)
- **Strategic Significance:** Foundational driver of all activities and value creation in the system

### Cost-Benefit Framework

- **Position:** Mid-chain position (0.65, 0.79)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-Built (+Product)
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical decision-making tool bridging strategic goals and implementation

### AI Implementation

- **Position:** Mid-chain position (0.45, 0.72)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-Built
- **Strategic Significance:** Key technological enabler requiring significant investment and coordination

## Evolution Analysis

The system shows a clear evolution from commodity components (regulatory compliance) to custom-built solutions (AI implementation) to product/utility elements (SDGs)

### Key Evolving Components
- Cost-Benefit Framework
- AI Implementation
- Infrastructure

### Disruption Risks
