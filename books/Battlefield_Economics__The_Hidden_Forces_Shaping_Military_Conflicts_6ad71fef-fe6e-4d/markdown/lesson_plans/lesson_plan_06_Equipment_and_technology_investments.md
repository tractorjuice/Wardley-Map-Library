### Explore
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide learners through an exploration of various categories of military technology investments

**Learner Activities:** In small groups, research and analyze different types of military technology investments using provided resources

**Resources Used:** Online databases, industry reports

**Differentiation:** Assign roles within groups based on expertise levels

**Technology Integration:** Utilize collaborative online research tools

### Explain
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Deliver a presentation on the economic principles behind military technology investments, including lifecycle costs and the 'military-technological treadmill'

**Learner Activities:** Take notes, ask questions, and participate in discussions on key economic concepts

**Resources Used:** Presentation slides, economic data visualizations

**Differentiation:** Provide supplementary reading materials for those seeking deeper economic analysis

**Technology Integration:** Use interactive infographics to illustrate complex economic relationships

### Elaborate
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Facilitate a scenario-based exercise where learners must develop a strategic investment plan for a fictional country

**Learner Activities:** Work in teams to create and present a balanced technology investment strategy, considering both military and economic factors

**Resources Used:** Scenario description, budget constraints, technology options

**Differentiation:** Adjust scenario complexity based on learner experience

**Technology Integration:** Use strategy simulation software to model investment outcomes

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Assess learner understanding through a combination of peer evaluation and individual reflection

**Learner Activities:** Present investment strategies, provide peer feedback, and complete a self-assessment questionnaire

**Resources Used:** Evaluation rubrics, reflection prompts

**Differentiation:** Offer multiple formats for presenting strategies (e.g., oral, written, visual)

**Technology Integration:** Use digital assessment tools for immediate feedback

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Ongoing observation and feedback during group activities and discussions
  - Alignment: Assesses ability to analyze and apply economic concepts in real-time
* **Summative**: Evaluation of the strategic investment plan developed during the Elaborate phase
  - Alignment: Measures ability to synthesize learning into a practical, professional-level strategy

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice defense professionals**: Provide additional background materials, pair with more experienced learners
* **Experienced military strategists**: Offer advanced scenario options, encourage mentoring of less experienced peers

## Cross-Disciplinary Connections
* International relations and diplomacy
* Public policy and governance
* Emerging technology trends in civilian sectors

## Real-World Applications
* Developing national defense budgets
* Negotiating international arms agreements
* Advising on military procurement strategies

## Metacognition Opportunities
* Reflect on how personal biases might influence technology investment decisions
* Consider how this learning changes previous assumptions about military spending

## Extension Activities
* Conduct a detailed cost-benefit analysis of a specific military technology
* Develop a presentation on the ethical implications of emerging military technologies

## Safety Considerations
* Ensure discussions remain focused on economic aspects rather than sensitive military information
* Remind participants of the importance of information security when discussing defense matters

## Reflection Questions
### For Learners
* How has this lesson changed your perspective on military technology investments?
* What challenges do you foresee in implementing balanced investment strategies in your professional context?

### For Facilitator
* How effectively did the lesson engage learners with diverse professional backgrounds?
