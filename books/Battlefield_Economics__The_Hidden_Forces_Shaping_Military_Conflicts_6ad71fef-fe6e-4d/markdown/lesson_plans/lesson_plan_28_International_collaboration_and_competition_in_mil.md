## Lesson Structure
### Engage
**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present a brief overview of a recent international military R&D collaboration (e.g., F-35 program) and its outcomes. Pose thought-provoking questions about the benefits and challenges of such collaborations.

**Learner Activities:** Participate in a group discussion on personal experiences or knowledge of international collaborations in their professional contexts.

**Resources Used:** Digital presentation slides, video clips of collaborative military projects

**Differentiation:** Provide additional context for those less familiar with specific military programs

**Technology Integration:** Use interactive polling software to gather initial thoughts and experiences

### Explore
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide learners through an analysis of the Wardley Map on international collaboration and competition in military R&D. Introduce key economic concepts related to collaboration and competition.

**Learner Activities:** In small groups, analyze different sections of the Wardley Map and discuss implications for military R&D strategies.

**Resources Used:** Wardley Map, economic data on military R&D spending

**Differentiation:** Provide simplified explanations of Wardley Mapping for those unfamiliar with the concept

**Technology Integration:** Use collaborative digital whiteboarding tools for group analysis

### Explain
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present detailed information on the advantages and challenges of international collaboration, as well as the drivers and implications of competition in military R&D. Discuss real-world examples and their economic impacts.

**Learner Activities:** Take notes, ask questions, and participate in discussions linking the presented information to their professional experiences.

**Resources Used:** Presentation slides, case studies of successful and challenging collaborations

**Differentiation:** Provide additional reading materials for those seeking deeper understanding

**Technology Integration:** Use interactive presentation software with embedded quizzes for engagement

### Elaborate
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Introduce a scenario-based activity where learners must develop a strategy for a hypothetical international military R&D project, balancing collaboration and competition.

**Learner Activities:** Work in teams to create and present strategies for the given scenario, considering economic, technological, and diplomatic factors.

**Resources Used:** Scenario description, strategy template, reference materials on international R&D agreements

**Differentiation:** Assign roles within teams based on individual expertise and experience

**Technology Integration:** Use virtual breakout rooms for team discussions and collaborative document editing tools

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Facilitate a reflection session on the strategies presented and their potential real-world applications. Summarize key learning points and future considerations in military R&D collaboration and competition.

**Learner Activities:** Participate in peer evaluation of presented strategies and reflect on personal learning and its application to their professional roles.

**Resources Used:** Evaluation rubric, reflection prompts

**Differentiation:** Offer multiple formats for reflection (written, verbal, visual)

**Technology Integration:** Use online forms for peer evaluations and personal reflections

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Ongoing observation and questioning during group discussions and activities
  - Alignment: Assesses understanding of key concepts and ability to apply them to professional contexts
* **Summative**: Evaluation of team strategies developed during the Elaborate phase
  - Alignment: Assesses ability to synthesize learning into practical strategies relevant to professional roles
* **Summative**: Individual reflection on learning and its application to professional practice
  - Alignment: Evaluates personal growth and ability to transfer learning to real-world situations

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice professionals**: Provide additional background information, pair with more experienced peers, offer simplified versions of complex concepts
* **Experienced professionals**: Encourage leadership roles in group activities, provide opportunities for sharing personal experiences, offer advanced reading materials
* **Technical specialists**: Focus on technological aspects of R&D, provide opportunities to delve deeper into specific technologies
* **Policy-focused professionals**: Emphasize diplomatic and economic aspects, provide additional policy-related case studies
