**Resources Used:** Presentation slides, Wardley Map from the content

**Differentiation:** Encourage participants to relate the concepts to their specific areas of expertise

**Technology Integration:** Use interactive presentation software to engage participants in real-time

### Elaborate
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Introduce a complex scenario requiring a cost-benefit analysis of mixed conventional and unconventional strategies

**Learner Activities:** In teams, develop and present a strategic plan that optimizes the cost-benefit ratio for the given scenario

**Resources Used:** Simulation software for cost-benefit analysis, scenario description

**Differentiation:** Assign roles within teams based on individual strengths and experiences

**Technology Integration:** Use collaborative online platforms for team strategy development

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Facilitate a peer review of the strategic plans presented

**Learner Activities:** Critically evaluate other teams' strategies and provide constructive feedback

**Resources Used:** Evaluation rubric aligned with learning objectives

**Differentiation:** Provide guiding questions tailored to different levels of expertise

**Technology Integration:** Use a digital feedback system for anonymous peer evaluations

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Ongoing observation and feedback during group discussions and activities
  - Alignment: Assesses participants' ability to apply concepts in real-time discussions
* **Summative**: Evaluation of final strategic plans presented by teams
  - Alignment: Measures ability to synthesize learning into a comprehensive strategy
* **Summative**: Individual reflection paper on the implications of the lesson for their professional role
  - Alignment: Assesses ability to connect learning to real-world professional contexts

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice military strategists**: Provide additional background readings, pair with experienced participants for mentoring
* **Experienced defense analysts**: Offer more complex scenarios, encourage them to lead group discussions and mentor others

## Cross-Disciplinary Connections
* International relations and diplomacy
* Economics and financial planning
* Technology and cybersecurity
* Political science and policy-making

## Real-World Applications

* Consider how this analysis changes previous assumptions about military strategy
* Identify areas for further personal development in strategic thinking

## Extension Activities
* Conduct a detailed cost-benefit analysis of a historical conflict
* Develop a presentation on the findings for senior leadership
* Create a predictive model for future conflict costs based on current trends

## Safety Considerations
* Ensure discussions remain focused on strategic aspects and avoid sensitive operational details
* Remind participants of information security protocols when discussing real-world applications

## Reflection Questions
### For Learners
* How has this lesson changed your perspective on military strategy and economics?
* What aspects of cost-benefit analysis in warfare do you feel you need to explore further?
