* Conflict resolution strategies

## Prior Knowledge
* Basic understanding of international relations
* Familiarity with major global territorial disputes
* General knowledge of economic principles

## Materials Needed
* Digital presentation slides
* Case study handouts
* Access to online mapping tools
* Whiteboard or digital collaboration platform

## Lesson Structure
### Engage
**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present a brief overview of a current territorial dispute with significant economic implications. Facilitate a group discussion on initial perceptions of the conflict's root causes.

**Learner Activities:** Participate in group discussion, sharing prior knowledge and initial hypotheses about the economic factors involved in the presented dispute.

**Resources Used:** Digital presentation with maps and key facts about the chosen dispute

**Differentiation:** Provide additional background information for those less familiar with the specific conflict

**Technology Integration:** Use interactive polling software to gather and display learners' initial perceptions

### Explore
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide learners through an exploration of various economic motivations behind territorial disputes, using the Wardley Map as a framework. Introduce case studies for small group analysis.

**Learner Activities:** In small groups, analyze assigned case studies, identifying and categorizing economic motivations using the Wardley Map framework.

**Resources Used:** Case study handouts, Wardley Map template

**Differentiation:** Assign case studies of varying complexity based on learners' expertise levels

**Technology Integration:** Utilize online collaborative tools for group work and Wardley Map creation

### Explain
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Lead a comprehensive discussion on the economic motivations identified in the case studies. Elaborate on key concepts such as natural resource control, strategic trade routes, and EEZs.

**Learner Activities:** Present group findings, engage in cross-group discussions, and ask clarifying questions about complex economic factors.

**Resources Used:** Whiteboard or digital platform for summarizing key points

**Differentiation:** Encourage advanced learners to draw connections between multiple case studies

**Technology Integration:** Use digital mind-mapping tools to visualize relationships between economic factors

### Elaborate
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Introduce a hypothetical territorial dispute scenario. Guide learners in applying their understanding to develop conflict resolution strategies that address economic interests.

**Learner Activities:** Work in teams to analyze the hypothetical scenario, develop resolution strategies, and prepare brief presentations on their approaches.

**Resources Used:** Hypothetical scenario description, strategy development worksheet

**Differentiation:** Provide additional prompts or constraints for teams needing more challenge

**Technology Integration:** Use online collaboration tools for team strategy development and presentation creation

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Facilitate team presentations of resolution strategies. Lead a reflective discussion on the applicability of these strategies to real-world disputes.

**Learner Activities:** Present team strategies, provide peer feedback, and engage in reflective discussion on lesson applications to professional contexts.

**Resources Used:** Rubric for evaluating resolution strategies

**Differentiation:** Offer optional advanced analysis for experienced professionals

**Technology Integration:** Use video conferencing features for breakout rooms and presentations

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Observation of group discussions and case study analyses
  - Alignment: Assesses ability to analyze economic factors in real-world contexts
* **Summative**: Evaluation of conflict resolution strategies developed for the hypothetical scenario
  - Alignment: Measures ability to apply understanding to create practical solutions

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice diplomats or policymakers**: Provide additional background readings, offer more structured analysis templates
* **Experienced international relations specialists**: Encourage deeper analysis of complex interplays between economic and non-economic factors, assign leadership roles in group activities

## Cross-Disciplinary Connections
* Environmental science (impact of resource exploitation)
* International law (legal frameworks for territorial claims)
* Political science (power dynamics in international relations)

## Real-World Applications
* Developing negotiation strategies for ongoing territorial disputes
* Assessing economic risks associated with potential conflicts
* Crafting policies to promote regional economic cooperation

## Metacognition Opportunities
* Reflect on how personal or national biases might influence perceptions of territorial disputes
* Consider how understanding economic motivations changes approach to conflict analysis

## Extension Activities
* Conduct an in-depth analysis of a current territorial dispute not covered in the lesson
* Develop a policy brief on economic strategies for de-escalating a specific regional conflict

## Safety Considerations
* Ensure discussions remain respectful and professional, especially when dealing with sensitive current events

## Reflection Questions
### For Learners
* How has this lesson changed your understanding of territorial disputes?
* In what ways can you apply this knowledge to your current professional role?

### For Facilitator
* How effectively did the Wardley Map framework enhance learners' understanding?
* What aspects of economic motivations seemed to resonate most with the learners?

## Adaptations for Virtual Learning
* Use breakout rooms for small group discussions and activities
* Employ shared online whiteboards for collaborative mapping and brainstorming
* Utilize asynchronous discussion forums for extended case study analysis

## Additional Resources
* Academic papers on resource-driven conflicts
* Reports from international organizations on economic aspects of territorial disputes
* Online courses on advanced conflict resolution techniques
