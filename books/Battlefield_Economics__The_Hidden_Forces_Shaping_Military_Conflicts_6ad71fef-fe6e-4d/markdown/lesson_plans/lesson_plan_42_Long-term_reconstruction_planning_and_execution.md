## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Ongoing assessment of group work and discussions throughout the lesson
  - Alignment: Aligns with objectives related to analysis and evaluation of reconstruction strategies
* **Summative**: Evaluation of final reconstruction plans developed by learners
  - Alignment: Directly assesses ability to design comprehensive reconstruction plans, aligning with the highest-level learning objective

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Experienced professionals in economic development**: Assign leadership roles in group activities, encourage sharing of real-world experiences
* **Professionals new to post-conflict reconstruction**: Provide additional resources and support, pair with more experienced learners for mentorship

## Cross-Disciplinary Connections
* Political science for governance aspects of reconstruction
* Social psychology for understanding community dynamics in post-conflict settings
* Urban planning for infrastructure development strategies

## Real-World Applications
* Developing reconstruction proposals for international aid organizations
* Advising governments on post-conflict economic recovery strategies
* Designing private sector engagement programs in fragile states

## Metacognition Opportunities
* Reflection on how personal biases might influence reconstruction planning
* Analysis of how learners' professional experiences shape their approach to post-conflict economics
* Consideration of ethical dilemmas in prioritizing reconstruction efforts

## Extension Activities
* Develop a detailed implementation plan for a specific sector within the reconstruction framework
* Create a risk assessment and mitigation strategy for a reconstruction plan
* Design a monitoring and evaluation system for tracking reconstruction progress

## Safety Considerations
* Sensitivity to cultural and historical contexts when discussing specific conflicts
* Awareness of potential emotional responses when dealing with post-conflict scenarios

## Reflection Questions
### For Learners
* How has this lesson changed your understanding of post-conflict reconstruction?
* What aspects of the reconstruction planning process do you find most challenging, and why?
* How might you apply the principles learned today in your current or future professional role?

### For Facilitator
