## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Ongoing observation of group discussions and activities
  - Alignment: Assesses learners' ability to analyze and evaluate cost factors in real-time
* **Summative**: Case study analysis and presentation
  - Alignment: Evaluates learners' ability to apply the cost analysis framework to a real-world scenario
* **Summative**: Individual reflection paper on the implications of cost analysis for demobilization program design
  - Alignment: Assesses learners' ability to synthesize learning and apply it to their professional context

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice professionals**: Provide additional background readings, pair with more experienced learners during group activities
* **Experienced professionals**: Offer more complex case studies, encourage them to share their experiences during discussions

## Cross-Disciplinary Connections
* Link to conflict resolution strategies
* Connect to sustainable development goals
* Explore intersections with public health initiatives in post-conflict regions

## Real-World Applications
* Designing cost-effective demobilization programs for ongoing conflicts
* Evaluating the economic impact of past demobilization efforts
* Advising policymakers on resource allocation for post-conflict reconstruction

## Metacognition Opportunities
* Reflect on how personal biases might influence cost analysis decisions
* Consider how this framework could be applied to other areas of post-conflict reconstruction
* Identify gaps in personal knowledge and create a plan for further learning

## Extension Activities
* Develop a proposal for a technology-enhanced demobilization program
* Conduct a comparative analysis of demobilization costs across different conflict regions
* Create a risk assessment model for demobilization program implementation

## Safety Considerations
* Ensure discussions remain respectful and sensitive to the complexities of post-conflict situations
* Maintain confidentiality when discussing real-world cases or personal experiences

## Reflection Questions
### For Learners
* How has this lesson changed your perspective on the economics of demobilization?
* What challenges do you anticipate in applying this cost analysis framework in your work?
* How might technological innovations reshape demobilization programs in the future?

### For Facilitator
