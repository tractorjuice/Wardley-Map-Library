## Lesson Structure
### Engage
**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present a provocative scenario involving a space-based military conflict and its immediate economic consequences. Facilitate a brief discussion on initial thoughts and reactions.

**Learner Activities:** Participate in group discussion, sharing initial perspectives on the economic implications of the scenario.

**Resources Used:** Digital presentation with scenario details

**Differentiation:** Provide background information sheets for those less familiar with space technology or military strategy

**Technology Integration:** Use interactive polling software to gather and display learner opinions in real-time

### Explore
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide learners through an exploration of key economic data related to space militarization. Introduce the Wardley mapping concept as a tool for analysis.

**Learner Activities:** In small groups, analyze provided economic data and begin creating a Wardley map for space militarization economics.

**Resources Used:** Economic datasets, Wardley mapping software

**Differentiation:** Provide pre-made partial Wardley maps for groups needing additional support

**Technology Integration:** Use collaborative online platforms for group work on Wardley maps

### Explain
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present a comprehensive overview of the economic implications of space militarization, including investment requirements, technological spillovers, and geopolitical considerations.

**Learner Activities:** Take notes, ask questions, and relate the presented information to their professional contexts.

**Resources Used:** Detailed presentation slides, infographics

**Differentiation:** Provide supplementary reading materials for those seeking deeper understanding

**Technology Integration:** Use multimedia presentations with embedded video clips and interactive elements

### Elaborate
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Facilitate a case study analysis of a hypothetical nation's space militarization program and its economic impacts.

**Learner Activities:** Work in teams to analyze the case study, applying concepts learned to develop economic strategies and recommendations.

**Resources Used:** Case study materials, economic analysis tools

**Differentiation:** Assign roles within teams based on individual expertise and learning needs

**Technology Integration:** Utilize online collaboration tools for team analysis and presentation preparation

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide learners through a reflection process on the implications of space militarization for their specific professional roles.

**Learner Activities:** Complete a self-assessment questionnaire and participate in a final group discussion on key takeaways.

**Resources Used:** Self-assessment questionnaire

**Differentiation:** Offer choice in reflection format (written, verbal, or visual)

**Technology Integration:** Use digital forms for self-assessment with immediate feedback capabilities

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Observation of group discussions and Wardley mapping process
  - Alignment: Assesses ability to analyze and synthesize complex economic information in a professional context
* **Summative**: Case study analysis presentation
  - Alignment: Evaluates ability to apply learned concepts to real-world scenarios relevant to professional roles
* **Summative**: Self-assessment questionnaire on learning objectives
  - Alignment: Allows learners to reflect on their understanding and application of key concepts in their professional context

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Professionals with limited space technology background**: Provide additional background readings, pair with more experienced peers during group work
* **Senior policy makers**: Focus on high-level strategic implications, provide opportunities to relate content to specific policy challenges

## Cross-Disciplinary Connections
* International relations and diplomacy
* Environmental science (space debris management)
* Public policy and governance
* Innovation management and technology transfer

## Real-World Applications
* Developing national space policies
* Assessing investment opportunities in space-related industries
* Negotiating international agreements on space activities
* Planning for economic impacts of potential space-based conflicts

## Metacognition Opportunities
* Reflection on how personal biases might influence perceptions of space militarization
* Analysis of how the lesson content changes previous understanding of space economics
* Consideration of ethical implications in professional decision-making related to space militarization

## Extension Activities
* Develop a policy brief on space militarization for their organization
* Create a risk assessment model for space-based economic activities
* Design a public communication strategy about the economic impacts of space militarization

## Safety Considerations
* Ensure discussions remain professional and respectful given potential sensitive nature of military topics
* Remind participants of any confidentiality requirements regarding their professional roles

## Reflection Questions
### For Learners
* How might the economic implications of space militarization affect your specific professional role or industry?
* What potential opportunities or challenges do you foresee in your field as a result of increased space militarization?
* How can you apply the strategic thinking tools learned today to other areas of your professional work?

### For Facilitator
* How effectively did the Wardley mapping activity engage learners with diverse professional backgrounds?
* What aspects of the economic implications seemed to resonate most with the learners, and how can this inform future sessions?
* Were there any unexpected questions or discussion points that should be incorporated into future iterations of this lesson?

## Adaptations for Virtual Learning
* Use breakout rooms for small group discussions and activities
* Employ virtual whiteboarding tools for collaborative Wardley mapping
* Utilize asynchronous discussion forums for extended reflection and peer interaction
* Provide pre-recorded video content for the 'Explain' phase to allow for more interactive live session time
