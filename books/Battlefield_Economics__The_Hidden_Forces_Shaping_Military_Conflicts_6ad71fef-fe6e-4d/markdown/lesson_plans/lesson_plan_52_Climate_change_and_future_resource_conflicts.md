## Lesson Structure
### Engage
**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present a brief overview of recent climate-related conflicts and their economic impacts. Facilitate a group discussion on participants' experiences with climate-related security issues in their professional roles.

**Learner Activities:** Participate in group discussion, sharing personal experiences and insights related to climate change and resource conflicts in their work.

**Resources Used:** Recent news articles, policy briefs on climate-related conflicts

**Differentiation:** Encourage participants to draw from their diverse professional backgrounds when contributing to the discussion

**Technology Integration:** Use a collaborative online platform to create a mind map of key issues identified during the discussion

### Explore
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide participants through an analysis of the Wardley Map provided in the lesson content. Introduce case studies of specific resource conflicts exacerbated by climate change.

**Learner Activities:** In small groups, analyze the Wardley Map and discuss its implications. Examine case studies and identify key economic and strategic factors at play.

**Resources Used:** Wardley Map, case study materials

**Differentiation:** Provide additional context or simplified versions of the Wardley Map for participants less familiar with the concept

**Technology Integration:** Use digital annotation tools to collaboratively analyze the Wardley Map

### Explain
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present detailed information on the economic implications of climate-induced resource conflicts, including costs of adaptation, investment in new technologies, and strategic resource allocation.

**Learner Activities:** Take notes, ask questions, and participate in guided discussions on the presented material. Begin to consider how this information applies to their specific professional contexts.

**Resources Used:** Presentation slides, economic data and projections

**Differentiation:** Provide supplementary readings for those wanting to delve deeper into specific economic aspects

**Technology Integration:** Use interactive polling software to gauge participants' understanding and gather real-time feedback

### Elaborate
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Facilitate a scenario-based exercise where participants must develop adaptive strategies for a hypothetical climate-induced resource conflict. Provide guidance on incorporating economic considerations into their strategies.

**Learner Activities:** Work in teams to develop and present adaptive strategies for the given scenario, considering both military and economic factors.

**Resources Used:** Scenario description, strategy development templates

**Differentiation:** Assign roles within teams based on participants' professional backgrounds and expertise

**Technology Integration:** Use virtual breakout rooms for team discussions and collaborative document editing for strategy development

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide participants through a reflection process on the strategies developed and lessons learned. Facilitate peer feedback on presented strategies.

**Learner Activities:** Present team strategies, provide constructive feedback to other teams, and reflect on personal learning and its application to their professional roles.

**Resources Used:** Evaluation rubric for strategies

**Differentiation:** Offer multiple formats for presenting strategies (e.g., written report, oral presentation, visual diagram)

**Technology Integration:** Use a digital feedback tool for peer evaluations and self-reflection submissions

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Ongoing assessment through participation in discussions and group activities
  - Alignment: Aligns with objectives related to analyzing impact and evaluating implications
* **Summative**: Evaluation of team-developed adaptive strategies for the scenario-based exercise
  - Alignment: Aligns with objectives related to developing strategies and assessing international cooperation
* **Summative**: Individual reflection paper on applying lesson concepts to participant's professional context
  - Alignment: Aligns with all learning objectives, emphasizing real-world application

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Participants with limited economics background**: Provide additional resources on basic economic concepts relevant to the lesson; pair with participants who have stronger economics backgrounds during group activities
* **Senior-level strategists**: Offer more complex scenarios and encourage them to consider broader, long-term implications in their strategy development

## Cross-Disciplinary Connections
* Environmental science for deeper understanding of climate change mechanisms
* International relations for context on global cooperation challenges
* Technology and innovation studies for insights into future resource management solutions

## Real-World Applications
* Developing climate-resilient military infrastructure plans
* Creating economic models for assessing long-term climate change impacts on strategic interests
* Designing international frameworks for resource sharing and conflict prevention

## Metacognition Opportunities
* Reflection on how personal and professional biases might influence strategy development
* Analysis of how the lesson has changed participants' perspectives on climate change as a security issue
* Consideration of gaps in current professional practices regarding climate-induced conflicts

## Extension Activities
* Develop a detailed climate adaptation plan for a specific military installation or operation
* Conduct a cost-benefit analysis of investing in climate change mitigation versus managing future resource conflicts
* Create a proposal for an international economic mechanism to address climate-induced resource disparities

## Safety Considerations
* Ensure discussions of potential conflicts remain hypothetical and do not disclose sensitive information
* Remind participants to consider ethical implications of strategies developed

## Reflection Questions
### For Learners
* How has this lesson changed your perception of the relationship between climate change and national security?
* What specific actions can you take in your current role to address the challenges discussed?
* How might the economic considerations presented influence future policy or strategy decisions in your field?

### For Facilitator
