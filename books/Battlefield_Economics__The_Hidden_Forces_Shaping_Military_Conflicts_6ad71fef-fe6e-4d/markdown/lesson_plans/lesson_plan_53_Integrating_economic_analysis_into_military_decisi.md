**Technology Integration:** Use a digital Q&A platform to manage and prioritize learner questions.

### Elaborate
**Duration:** 60 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Introduce a complex case study of a military operation with significant economic factors. Guide learners through the process of applying economic analysis to the case.

**Learner Activities:** Work in teams to analyze the case study, applying economic principles and creating a strategic plan that incorporates economic considerations.

**Resources Used:** Case study materials, economic analysis tools

**Differentiation:** Assign roles within teams based on individual strengths and experiences.

**Technology Integration:** Use simulation software to model economic outcomes of different strategic choices.

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Facilitate team presentations of their case study analyses and strategic plans. Lead a reflective discussion on the learning process and key takeaways.

**Learner Activities:** Present team findings, provide peer feedback, and reflect on personal learning and professional applications.

**Resources Used:** Presentation software, peer evaluation rubrics

**Differentiation:** Offer multiple presentation formats (e.g., oral, visual, written) to accommodate different strengths.

**Technology Integration:** Use a digital platform for peer feedback and self-reflection submissions.

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Ongoing observation and feedback during group activities and discussions
  - Alignment: Assesses learners' ability to apply economic concepts to military scenarios in real-time
* **Summative**: Team presentation and report on the case study analysis
  - Alignment: Evaluates learners' ability to integrate economic analysis into a comprehensive military strategy
* **Summative**: Individual reflection paper on the potential applications of economic analysis in their specific professional role
  - Alignment: Assesses learners' ability to transfer learning to their unique professional contexts

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Participants with strong economic background**: Provide advanced economic modeling tasks and leadership roles in group activities
* **Participants with limited economic experience**: Offer additional resources and scaffolded exercises to build economic literacy

## Cross-Disciplinary Connections
* International relations and diplomacy
* Public policy and governance
* Data science and predictive analytics
* Organizational psychology and change management

## Real-World Applications
* Developing economically sustainable military capabilities
* Conducting cost-benefit analyses for proposed military interventions
* Integrating economic intelligence into strategic planning processes
* Optimizing resource allocation in military operations

## Metacognition Opportunities
* Reflective journaling on the evolution of personal perspectives throughout the lesson
* Group discussions on the challenges of integrating economic thinking into traditional military paradigms
* Self-assessment of economic literacy and areas for further professional development

## Extension Activities
* Develop an economic analysis framework for a current or potential military operation in the learner's area of responsibility
* Create a proposal for integrating economic analysis tools into existing military decision-making processes
* Conduct a Wardley mapping exercise for the learner's organization to identify areas for economic integration

## Safety Considerations
* Ensure discussions of sensitive military information comply with security protocols
* Address potential ethical considerations in prioritizing economic factors in military decisions

## Reflection Questions
### For Learners
* How has this lesson changed your perspective on the role of economics in military strategy?
* What challenges do you anticipate in implementing economic analysis in your professional role?
* How can you promote a culture of economic literacy within your organization?

### For Facilitator
* How effectively did the lesson engage learners with diverse economic backgrounds?
