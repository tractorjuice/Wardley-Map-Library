**Technology Integration:** Use interactive polling software to gauge initial perspectives on economic-security balance.

### Explore
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide learners through an exploration of economic analysis tools and their application to security scenarios.

**Learner Activities:** In small groups, analyze a given security scenario using provided economic analysis tools.

**Resources Used:** Economic analysis software, scenario descriptions

**Differentiation:** Provide varying levels of complexity in scenarios based on learner experience.

**Technology Integration:** Utilize collaborative online platforms for group work and data visualization.

### Explain
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present key concepts of battlefield economics and strategies for balancing economic and security considerations.

**Learner Activities:** Take notes, ask questions, and relate concepts to their professional contexts.

**Resources Used:** Digital presentation, Wardley Map

**Differentiation:** Provide additional examples for complex concepts as needed.

**Technology Integration:** Use interactive Wardley Map tool to illustrate strategic concepts.

### Elaborate
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Facilitate a simulation exercise where learners must make strategic decisions balancing economic and security factors.

**Learner Activities:** Participate in simulation, making decisions and observing outcomes.

**Resources Used:** Military strategy simulation software

**Differentiation:** Assign roles based on learners' backgrounds and expertise.

**Technology Integration:** Use advanced simulation software to model complex scenarios and outcomes.

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide reflection on simulation outcomes and overall learning.

**Learner Activities:** Discuss simulation results, reflect on learning, and complete self-assessment.

**Resources Used:** Reflection prompts, self-assessment rubric

**Differentiation:** Provide varied reflection prompts based on learners' roles in the simulation.

**Technology Integration:** Use digital platforms for collaborative reflection and feedback.

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Observation of participation and decision-making during simulation exercise
  - Alignment: Assesses ability to apply economic-security balancing concepts in realistic scenarios
* **Summative**: Written analysis of a new case study, proposing strategies to balance economic and security considerations
  - Alignment: Evaluates learners' ability to synthesize concepts and create original strategies

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Experienced military strategists**: Provide more complex scenarios and encourage mentoring of less experienced participants
* **Participants with strong economic background**: Assign leadership roles in economic analysis aspects of group activities

## Cross-Disciplinary Connections
* International relations and diplomacy
* Public policy and governance
* Technology and innovation management

## Real-World Applications
* Developing national security strategies
* Planning military interventions and peacekeeping operations
* Allocating defense budgets
* Assessing the economic impact of security policies

## Metacognition Opportunities
* Reflection on how economic considerations have influenced past professional decisions
* Self-assessment of strengths and areas for improvement in integrating economic and security thinking

## Extension Activities
* Develop an economic impact assessment for a current security policy in the learner's professional context
* Create a proposal for enhancing economic-security integration in the learner's organization

## Safety Considerations
* Ensure confidentiality of any sensitive information shared during discussions
* Remind participants to adhere to security protocols when discussing real-world applications

## Reflection Questions
### For Learners
* How has this lesson changed your perspective on the role of economics in military strategy?
* What challenges do you anticipate in implementing these concepts in your professional role?
* How can you promote interdisciplinary collaboration in your organization?

### For Facilitator
