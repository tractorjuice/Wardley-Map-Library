---

# Introduction

- Critical decision point in battlefield economics
- Impacts military effectiveness and resource allocation
- Balancing efficiency with strategic resilience

---

# Just-in-Time (JIT) Logistics

- Borrowed from manufacturing sector
- Delivers resources precisely when and where needed
- Minimizes inventory costs and logistical footprint

---

# Stockpiling Strategy

- Accumulation of large quantities of supplies in advance
- Ensures readiness
- Potentially incurs significant storage and maintenance costs

---

# JIT Advantages and Disadvantages

- Cost efficiency
- Reduced logistical footprint
- Flexibility

Disadvantages:
- Vulnerability to supply chain disruptions
- Reliance on robust transportation networks

---

# Stockpiling Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages:
- Resilience against disruptions
- Immediate availability
- Deterrent effect

Disadvantages:
- High storage costs
- Risk of obsolescence
- Potential target for enemy attacks

---

# Hybrid Approach

- Combination of JIT and stockpiling strategies
- Optimizes resource allocation while maintaining resilience
- Balance depends on conflict nature, geography, and technological capabilities

---

# Technological Advancements

- Reshaping military logistics landscape
- Predictive analytics and AI enhancing demand forecasting
- Additive manufacturing enabling on-demand production

---

# Economic Implications

- Influence on long-term defence budgeting
- Impact on infrastructure development
- Potential effects on diplomatic relations

---

# Conclusion

- Not a binary choice, but a spectrum
- Dynamic adjustment crucial for military success
- Evolving battlefield economics require adaptive strategies
