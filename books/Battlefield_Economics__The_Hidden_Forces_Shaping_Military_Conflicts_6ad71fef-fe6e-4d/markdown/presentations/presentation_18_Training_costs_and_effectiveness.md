---

# Introduction

- Critical investment in military operations
- Complex relationship between costs and effectiveness
- Impacts operational effectiveness and mission success

---

# Types of Training Costs

- Direct costs: Instructors, facilities, equipment
- Indirect costs: Trainee salaries, accommodation
- Opportunity costs: Time away from active duty
- Long-term costs: Refresher training, skill maintenance

---

# Challenges in Assessing Effectiveness

- Difficulty in quantifying Return on Investment (ROI)
- Intangible benefits often apparent only in combat
- Balancing budget constraints with training quality

---

# Technological Advancements in Training

- Virtual Reality (VR) for scenario replication
- Augmented Reality (AR) enhancing real-world exercises
- Blended approaches combining virtual and live elements
- Cost-effective solutions for complex simulations
