## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the complex economic dynamics and strategic interactions between guerrilla forces and conventional forces in asymmetric warfare scenarios.

**Anchor:** The anchor appears to be the Economic Impact component, which is central to the map and influences public support and overall strategy.

## Component Analysis

### Guerrilla Forces

- **Position:** Low visibility, high value
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis/Custom
- **Strategic Significance:** Core element of asymmetric warfare, highly adaptable and cost-effective

### Conventional Forces

- **Position:** High visibility, high value
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Traditional military power, but potentially less cost-effective in guerrilla scenarios

### Local Support

- **Position:** Low visibility, high value
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for guerrilla operations, provides resources and intelligence

### Economic Impact

- **Position:** Medium visibility, medium value
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Central to the overall conflict, influences public opinion and strategy

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a mix of evolving components, with traditional military elements more evolved than guerrilla tactics and local support.

### Key Evolving Components
- Weapons and Equipment
- Intelligence Gathering
- Counter-insurgency Strategies

### Disruption Risks
- Conventional Forces
- Critical Infrastructure

## Value Chain Analysis

Value flows from local support to guerrilla forces, impacting critical infrastructure and economic outcomes, which in turn affect public support and conventional forces' strategies.

### Critical Paths
- Local Support -> Guerrilla Forces -> Critical Infrastructure -> Economic Impact -> Public Support

### Bottlenecks
- Intelligence Gathering
- Counter-insurgency Strategies

## Strategic Positioning

Guerrilla forces are positioned to leverage local support and psychological warfare, while conventional forces rely on advanced weapons and intelligence gathering.
