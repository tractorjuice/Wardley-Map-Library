## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the complex ecosystem of economic sanctions, including various types of sanctions, their effects, and the factors influencing their effectiveness.

**Anchor:** The anchor appears to be 'Political Outcomes' [0.30, 0.90], representing the ultimate goal of economic sanctions. Its high visibility and low evolution indicate it's a well-understood but complex objective.

## Component Analysis

### Sanction Types

- **Position:** High visibility (0.95) and high evolution (0.80)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Core component defining the various tools available for economic pressure. Its high evolution suggests well-established, standardized sanction categories.

### Economic Pressure

- **Position:** High visibility (0.70) and high evolution (0.85)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Key intermediary between sanction types and political outcomes. Its position indicates it's a well-understood mechanism for influencing target nations.

### Target Nation

- **Position:** Moderate visibility (0.50) and high evolution (0.85)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Central to the sanctions ecosystem. Its position reflects the complexity of understanding and influencing target nations.

### Smart Sanctions

- **Position:** Moderate visibility (0.60) and high evolution (0.88)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Represents an advanced approach to sanctions. Its high evolution suggests it's becoming a standard practice in sanction design.

### Digital Currencies

- **Position:** Low visibility (0.30) and low evolution (0.55)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Emerging technology with potential to disrupt traditional financial sanctions. Its low position indicates it's still developing but has significant future impact potential.
