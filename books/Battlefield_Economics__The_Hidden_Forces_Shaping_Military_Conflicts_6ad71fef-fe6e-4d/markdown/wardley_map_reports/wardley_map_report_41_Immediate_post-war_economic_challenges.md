## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the key components and their relationships in post-war economic recovery, ranging from immediate humanitarian aid to long-term economic stability factors.

**Anchor:** The anchor is the 'Post-War Economy', representing the overarching goal of economic recovery after conflict. Its significance lies in being the focal point that all other components ultimately serve.

## Component Analysis

### Humanitarian Aid

- **Position:** High visibility, high evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Product/Rental
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for immediate post-war stabilization, but expected to decrease in importance as recovery progresses

### Macroeconomic Stability

- **Position:** High visibility, high evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Product/Rental
- **Strategic Significance:** Fundamental for long-term economic recovery, requires consistent policy implementation

### Institutional Framework

- **Position:** Low visibility, mid-evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-Built
- **Strategic Significance:** Essential for sustainable recovery, but challenging to develop quickly

### Financial Sector

- **Position:** Mid visibility, mid-evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Product/Rental
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for facilitating economic growth and investment
