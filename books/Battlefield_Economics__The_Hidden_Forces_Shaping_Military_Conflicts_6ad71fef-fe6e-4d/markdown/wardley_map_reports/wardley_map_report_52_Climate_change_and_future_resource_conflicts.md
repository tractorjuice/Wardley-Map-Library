## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the complex interplay between climate change, resource scarcity, and military strategy in a future marked by environmental challenges.

**Anchor:** Climate Change serves as the anchor, driving the need for adaptation across various sectors and influencing military and economic strategies.

## Component Analysis

### Climate Change

- **Position:** High visibility, high evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Commodity/Utility
- **Strategic Significance:** Central driver of all other components, necessitating adaptive strategies across sectors.

### Water Resources

- **Position:** High visibility, near commodity
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical resource likely to be a source of conflict and requiring innovative management.

### Military Strategy

- **Position:** Moderate visibility, moderate evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Key in addressing resource conflicts and climate-induced challenges.

### Arctic Resources

- **Position:** Low visibility, moderate evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Emerging area of interest with potential for resource extraction and geopolitical tension.
