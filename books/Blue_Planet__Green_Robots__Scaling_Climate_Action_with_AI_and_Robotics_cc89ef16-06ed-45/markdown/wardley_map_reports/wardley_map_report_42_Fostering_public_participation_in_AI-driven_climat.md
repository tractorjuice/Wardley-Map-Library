- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Core enabling technology for climate solutions. Its position suggests it's well-developed but not yet commoditized, offering opportunities for innovation and differentiation.

### Climate Data

- **Position:** Medium visibility (0.55) and high ubiquity (0.70)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+commodity)
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical input for AI-driven climate solutions. Its high ubiquity suggests it's widely available, but there may be opportunities to improve its visibility and utilization.

### Policy Integration

- **Position:** Low visibility (0.20) and low ubiquity (0.40)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Crucial for creating an enabling environment for AI climate solutions. Its low position suggests significant work is needed to develop and implement supportive policies.
