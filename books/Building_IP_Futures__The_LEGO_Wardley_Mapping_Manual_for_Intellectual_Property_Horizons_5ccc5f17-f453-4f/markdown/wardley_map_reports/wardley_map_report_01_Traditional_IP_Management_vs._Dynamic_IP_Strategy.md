## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the transition from traditional intellectual property (IP) management practices to a more dynamic and strategic approach to IP. It shows various components of IP management across different stages of evolution, from genesis to commodity.

**Anchor:** The anchor appears to be 'Dynamic IP Strategy', positioned as a more evolved approach compared to 'Traditional IP Management'. This signifies a shift in how organizations view and utilize their intellectual property assets, moving from a defensive, static approach to a more proactive and integrated strategy.

## Component Analysis

### Traditional IP Management

- **Position:** Positioned in the Product/Rental phase (0.65, 0.75)
- **Evolution Stage:** Late Product stage
- **Strategic Significance:** Represents the established approach to IP management, but showing signs of inertia and potential for disruption

### Dynamic IP Strategy

- **Position:** Positioned in the Custom-Built phase (0.35, 0.85)
- **Evolution Stage:** Early Custom-Built stage
- **Strategic Significance:** Represents the emerging, more strategic approach to IP management, aligned with innovation ecosystems and technological change

### Wardley Mapping for IP

- **Position:** Positioned in the Genesis phase (0.15, 0.70)
