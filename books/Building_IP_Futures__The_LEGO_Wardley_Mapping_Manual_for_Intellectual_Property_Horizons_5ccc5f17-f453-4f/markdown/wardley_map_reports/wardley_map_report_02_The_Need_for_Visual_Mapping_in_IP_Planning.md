## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the IP evolution process in a public research institution, from basic research to commercial application, with a focus on IP strategy and visual mapping.

**Anchor:** The anchor is the Public Research Institution, positioned at [0.95, 0.85]. This represents the primary entity driving the entire value chain and IP evolution process.

## Component Analysis

### Visual Mapping

- **Position:** [0.15, 0.90] with evolution to 0.45
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis to Custom-Built
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for enhancing IP strategy, stakeholder communication, risk management, and opportunity identification. Its evolving nature suggests it's a key area for innovation and competitive advantage.

### IP Portfolio

- **Position:** [0.55, 0.75]
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Central to the institution's IP strategy, encompassing various forms of IP. Its position suggests it's well-established but still has room for optimization.

### Technology Transfer

- **Position:** [0.65, 0.55]
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical link between research outputs and commercial application. Its position indicates it's a well-established process but could benefit from further commoditization.
