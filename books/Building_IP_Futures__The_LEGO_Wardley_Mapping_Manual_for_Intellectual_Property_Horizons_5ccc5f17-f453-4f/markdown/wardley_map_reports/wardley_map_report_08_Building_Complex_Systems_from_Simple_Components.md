## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates an IP strategy approach based on modular, interconnected components, similar to LEGO building blocks. It shows the relationship between high-level strategy elements, IP assets, and innovation horizons.

**Anchor:** The anchor is the 'User', positioned at the top right, indicating that the entire IP strategy is ultimately driven by user needs and market demands.

## Component Analysis

### IP Strategy

- **Position:** High value, custom-built
- **Evolution Stage:** Late Product (+67%)
- **Strategic Significance:** Central to the entire system, bridging user needs with modular IP components

### Modularity

- **Position:** High value, moving towards product
- **Evolution Stage:** Early Product (+59%)
- **Strategic Significance:** Key enabler for flexible and scalable IP asset management

### IP Assets

- **Position:** Mid-value, product stage
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+39%)
- **Strategic Significance:** Core building blocks of the IP strategy, with potential for further commoditization

### Innovation Horizons

- **Position:** Lower value, early product stage
- **Evolution Stage:** Early Product (+19%)
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for long-term strategy, linking IP assets to business growth
