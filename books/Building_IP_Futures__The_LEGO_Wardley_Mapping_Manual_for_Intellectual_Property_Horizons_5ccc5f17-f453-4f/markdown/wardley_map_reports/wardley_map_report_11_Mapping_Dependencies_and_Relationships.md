## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the IP landscape for a LEGO-inspired organization, focusing on core IP assets, their dependencies, and organizational components that support IP strategy.

**Anchor:** The anchor is 'IP Strategy', positioned at the top right. This represents the ultimate user need and strategic goal, driving all other components and activities in the map.

## Component Analysis

### Core IP Assets

- **Position:** High value, high certainty (0.8, 0.9)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Central to the organization's value proposition and competitive advantage

### LEGO Wardley Mapping

- **Position:** Mid-value, mid-certainty (0.3, 0.5)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built (evolving to 0.6)
- **Strategic Significance:** Key strategic tool for understanding and managing the IP landscape

### R&D Teams

- **Position:** Low value, low certainty (0.5, 0.2)
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for innovation and maintaining competitive edge in IP development

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a range of evolutionary stages, from genesis (R&D Teams) to product (Core IP Assets). This indicates a mature IP strategy with ongoing innovation efforts.
