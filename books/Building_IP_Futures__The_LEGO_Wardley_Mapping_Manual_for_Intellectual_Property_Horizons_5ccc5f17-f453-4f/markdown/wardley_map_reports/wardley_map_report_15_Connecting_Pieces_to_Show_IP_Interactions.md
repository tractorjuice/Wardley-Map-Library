## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the landscape of intellectual property (IP) management and strategy, focusing on the interactions between different IP components across innovation horizons.

**Anchor:** The anchor appears to be IP Strategy, positioned at the top of the value chain. This signifies that all other components ultimately serve to inform and execute the overarching IP strategy.

## Component Analysis

### IP Strategy

- **Position:** High value, high evolution (0.85, 0.89)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Central to guiding all IP-related decisions and activities

### IP Asset Visualization

- **Position:** Mid-value, mid-evolution (0.55, 0.75)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (evolving to 0.70)
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for understanding and leveraging IP assets across horizons

### R&D Efforts

- **Position:** Low-value, mid-evolution (0.40, 0.55)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built (evolving to 0.55)
- **Strategic Significance:** Key driver for future IP assets and innovation

### Future IP Assets

- **Position:** Low-value, low-evolution (0.30, 0.40)
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis (evolving to 0.45)
- **Strategic Significance:** Represents potential for future competitive advantage
