## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the components and relationships involved in developing and executing an IP strategy. It spans from user needs to R&D efforts, encompassing various IP assets and strategic activities.

**Anchor:** The anchor is 'User Need', positioned at the top right. This signifies that all IP strategy efforts should ultimately serve and be driven by user needs, ensuring market relevance and value creation.

## Component Analysis

### IP Assets

- **Position:** High value, moderate certainty
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built to Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Core component bridging user needs and specific IP types, critical for value creation and competitive advantage

### Patents

- **Position:** Moderate value, high certainty
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Key for protecting inventions and maintaining market exclusivity

### Data Sets

- **Position:** Low value, moderate certainty
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis to Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Emerging asset class with potential for significant future value in AI and analytics

### LEGO Visualization

- **Position:** Low value, low certainty
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis
- **Strategic Significance:** Novel approach for IP strategy visualization, potential for improving strategy communication and analysis
