**Resources Used:** Digital slides, case study handouts

**Differentiation:** Provide case studies of varying complexity to suit different experience levels

**Technology Integration:** Use a collaborative digital workspace for group analysis and sharing

### Explain
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Elaborate on each concept, providing examples from successful public sector communications

**Learner Activities:** Take notes, ask questions, and participate in guided discussions on concept applications

**Resources Used:** Detailed concept explanations, real-world examples

**Differentiation:** Offer visual, auditory, and kinesthetic explanations to cater to different learning styles

**Technology Integration:** Use interactive infographics to visualize concept relationships

### Elaborate
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide learners through applying concepts to their own work contexts

**Learner Activities:** Develop a value communication strategy for a current or upcoming project using the learned frameworks

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Ongoing observation and feedback during group activities and discussions
  - Alignment: Assesses understanding and application of concepts in real-time
* **Summative**: Evaluation of the value communication strategy developed during the Elaborate phase
  - Alignment: Demonstrates ability to apply all three frameworks to a real professional scenario

## Differentiation Strategies
