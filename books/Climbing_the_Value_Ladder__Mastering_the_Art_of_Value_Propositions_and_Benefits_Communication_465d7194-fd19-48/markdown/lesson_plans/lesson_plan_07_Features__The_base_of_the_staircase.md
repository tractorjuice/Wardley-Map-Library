**Learner Activities:** Take notes, ask questions, and refine their Wardley Maps based on new information.

**Resources Used:** Presentation slides, interactive Wardley Map examples

**Differentiation:** Offer advanced concepts for experienced learners, while reinforcing basics for others

**Technology Integration:** Use screen sharing and interactive presentations

### Elaborate
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Facilitate a workshop on developing and presenting feature-based value propositions. Provide guidance on integrating features with higher levels of the Value Staircase.

**Learner Activities:** Develop a comprehensive feature communication strategy for a real or hypothetical product/service, including a Wardley Map and prioritized feature list.

**Resources Used:** Feature strategy template, Wardley Mapping software

**Differentiation:** Allow choice of industry-specific scenarios for the activity

**Technology Integration:** Use project management tools to organize feature strategies

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Assess learner understanding through a combination of peer review and facilitator feedback on the developed strategies.

**Resources Used:** Rubric for evaluating feature communication strategies

**Differentiation:** Adjust expectations based on learner experience level

**Technology Integration:** Use online feedback tools for peer assessments

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Ongoing observation and feedback during group activities and discussions
  - Alignment: Aligns with objectives related to understanding and analyzing features
* **Summative**: Evaluation of final feature communication strategy and Wardley Map
  - Alignment: Aligns with objectives related to creating and evaluating feature-based value propositions

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice professionals**: Provide additional guidance on basic concepts, offer templates for feature categorization
* **Experienced professionals**: Challenge with complex scenarios, encourage deeper analysis of strategic implications

## Cross-Disciplinary Connections
* Link feature communication to project management methodologies
* Explore connections between feature development and user experience design
* Discuss implications of feature communication for legal and compliance roles

## Real-World Applications
* Developing product specifications for government tenders
* Creating marketing materials for complex B2B solutions
* Aligning product features with regulatory requirements in highly regulated industries

## Metacognition Opportunities
* Reflect on past experiences with feature communication and identify areas for improvement
* Consider how understanding of features impacts overall value proposition development
* Analyze personal biases in prioritizing certain types of features over others

## Extension Activities
* Conduct a feature audit of a real product or service in the learner's organization
* Create a feature communication guide for a specific industry or market segment
* Develop a training module on feature identification and prioritization for junior team members

## Safety Considerations
