## Lesson Structure
### Engage
**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present a real-world scenario of a public service failing to meet basic citizen needs. Facilitate a discussion on the consequences and potential solutions.

**Learner Activities:** Participate in group discussion, sharing experiences and initial thoughts on functional value in public services.

**Resources Used:** Digital presentation with scenario, discussion prompts

**Differentiation:** Provide both visual and verbal presentation of the scenario to accommodate different learning styles.

**Technology Integration:** Use digital polling tool for real-time participant input and engagement.

### Explore
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide learners through an exploration of the Value Pyramid concept, focusing on functional value. Introduce Wardley Mapping as a tool for visualizing service components.

**Learner Activities:** In small groups, analyze case studies of public services, identifying elements of functional value. Begin creating a Wardley Map for a chosen service.

**Resources Used:** Case study handouts, Wardley Map creation tool

**Differentiation:** Provide varied complexity levels in case studies to challenge different experience levels.

**Technology Integration:** Use collaborative online tools for group work and Wardley Map creation.

### Explain
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present detailed information on functional value components (reliability, efficiency, effectiveness, accessibility, quality). Demonstrate how to articulate these in the context of public services.

**Learner Activities:** Take notes, ask questions, and participate in discussions on how to apply these concepts to their specific areas of work.

**Resources Used:** Digital presentation slides, interactive Q&A platform

**Differentiation:** Provide real-time transcription for audio content to support diverse learning needs.

**Technology Integration:** Use an interactive Q&A platform to encourage participation and address individual queries.

### Elaborate
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Facilitate a workshop on developing strategies to enhance and communicate functional value in public services. Guide learners in creating action plans for their departments.

**Learner Activities:** Work in teams to develop action plans for improving functional value in a specific public service. Present and defend their strategies to the larger group.

**Resources Used:** Digital collaboration tools, presentation platform

**Differentiation:** Assign roles within teams based on individual strengths and areas for growth.

**Technology Integration:** Use digital collaboration tools for team strategy development and virtual presentation platforms for sharing ideas.

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Administer a summative assessment to evaluate understanding of functional value concepts and application in public sector contexts.

**Learner Activities:** Complete the assessment, reflecting on their learning and how they will apply it in their roles.

**Resources Used:** Online assessment tool, reflection prompts

**Differentiation:** Offer multiple formats for assessment (e.g., written, oral, project-based) to accommodate different strengths.

**Technology Integration:** Use an adaptive online assessment tool that adjusts question difficulty based on learner responses.

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Ongoing observation and feedback during group activities and discussions
  - Alignment: Aligns with objectives on analyzing and evaluating functional value in real-time scenarios
* **Summative**: Case study analysis where learners must identify, evaluate, and propose improvements to functional value in a given public service
  - Alignment: Aligns with all learning objectives, requiring application of concepts to a realistic professional scenario

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice public sector professionals**: Provide additional background materials on public sector operations and value creation; offer more structured guidance in group activities
* **Experienced policy makers**: Present more complex case studies; encourage them to lead group discussions and mentor less experienced colleagues

## Cross-Disciplinary Connections
* Link functional value concepts to financial management in public sector
* Explore connections with digital transformation initiatives in government
* Discuss implications for public-private partnerships in service delivery

## Real-World Applications
* Redesigning citizen-facing digital platforms for improved accessibility
* Developing performance metrics for public transportation services
* Creating communication strategies for new public health initiatives

## Metacognition Opportunities
* Reflect on personal experiences as citizens receiving public services
* Analyze how understanding of functional value has evolved throughout the lesson
* Consider how this knowledge will impact future decision-making in their roles

## Extension Activities
* Conduct a functional value audit of a department's services
* Develop a citizen feedback mechanism to continually assess functional value
* Create a training module on functional value for new employees in their department

## Safety Considerations
* Ensure discussions about public services maintain citizen privacy and data protection
* Address ethical considerations in service delivery and value communication

## Reflection Questions
### For Learners
* How has your understanding of functional value in public services changed?
* What challenges do you anticipate in implementing these concepts in your work?
* How might improving functional value in your area impact citizen trust and engagement?

### For Facilitator
* How effectively did the Wardley Mapping activity enhance understanding of functional value?
* Were the case studies relevant and challenging for all experience levels?
* What adjustments could be made to improve the practical application of concepts for learners?

## Adaptations for Virtual Learning
* Use breakout rooms for small group discussions and activities
* Employ virtual whiteboards for collaborative Wardley Mapping exercises
* Utilize asynchronous discussion forums for extended reflection and peer learning

## Additional Resources
* Government Digital Service (GDS) Design Principles
* OECD Report on Digital Government Strategies
* Academic papers on public value creation in digital era governance
