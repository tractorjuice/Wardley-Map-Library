**Differentiation:** Assign different feedback methods to groups based on their experience level

**Technology Integration:** Use collaborative online platforms for group research and presentation preparation

### Explain
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present key concepts of feedback analysis, including quantitative and qualitative techniques. Demonstrate the use of data analysis tools for deriving insights.

**Learner Activities:** Take notes, ask questions, and participate in guided practice of data analysis techniques.

**Resources Used:** Data analysis software, sample datasets

**Differentiation:** Provide additional support for learners less experienced with data analysis

**Technology Integration:** Use screen sharing to demonstrate data analysis techniques in real-time

### Elaborate
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Facilitate a workshop on developing action plans based on feedback insights. Guide discussions on balancing diverse stakeholder needs and considering societal impact.

**Learner Activities:** Work in teams to develop action plans for a given case study, present and defend their plans to the class.

**Resources Used:** Case study materials, action plan templates

**Differentiation:** Provide varying levels of complexity in case studies based on learner experience

**Technology Integration:** Use digital collaboration tools for team planning and presentation

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Administer a summative assessment and facilitate a reflection session on learning and application to professional contexts.

**Learner Activities:** Complete the assessment and participate in reflective discussion.

**Resources Used:** Assessment materials, reflection prompts

**Differentiation:** Offer choice in assessment format (e.g., written, presentation, or practical demonstration)

**Technology Integration:** Use online assessment tools for immediate feedback

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Observation of group discussions and activities throughout the lesson
  - Alignment: Assesses engagement and application of concepts in real-time
* **Summative**: Case study analysis: Develop a comprehensive feedback strategy and improvement plan for a public sector organization
  - Alignment: Aligns with all learning objectives and simulates real-world application

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice professionals**: Provide additional guidance on data analysis techniques, offer simplified case studies
* **Experienced professionals**: Offer more complex scenarios, encourage mentoring of less experienced peers, provide opportunities for advanced analysis techniques

## Cross-Disciplinary Connections
* Data science and analytics
* Public policy and governance
* Organizational psychology
* Marketing and communications

## Real-World Applications
* Improving citizen satisfaction with government services

* Consider how learners' own experiences as citizens influence their approach to feedback analysis
* Evaluate the effectiveness of current feedback practices in learners' organizations

## Extension Activities
* Conduct a mini-audit of current feedback practices in learners' organizations
* Develop a proposal for implementing a new feedback collection method
* Create a presentation for senior management on the importance of customer feedback in value optimization

## Safety Considerations
* Ensure data privacy and confidentiality when handling customer feedback
* Consider ethical implications of feedback collection methods
* Be mindful of potential political sensitivities in public sector contexts

## Reflection Questions
### For Learners
