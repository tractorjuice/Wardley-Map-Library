## Lesson Structure
### Engage
**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present a real-world example of a poorly communicated value proposition. Facilitate a discussion on why it fails to resonate with customers.

**Learner Activities:** Analyze the example, identify missing links between attributes and benefits, and discuss potential improvements.

**Resources Used:** Presentation slides, discussion prompts

**Differentiation:** Provide additional context for less experienced professionals

**Technology Integration:** Use interactive polling software for real-time feedback and engagement

### Explore
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide learners through a collaborative exercise to identify product attributes and customer needs for a given case study.

**Learner Activities:** Work in small groups to research and list product attributes and customer needs, then create an initial mapping matrix.

**Resources Used:** Case study materials, online research tools

**Differentiation:** Provide pre-populated matrices for groups that need additional support

**Technology Integration:** Use collaborative online whiteboards for group work and sharing

### Explain
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present the process of linking attributes to functional benefits, using examples from various industries. Demonstrate the use of a Benefits Ladder template.

**Learner Activities:** Take notes, ask questions, and begin to apply the process to their case study work from the Explore phase.

**Resources Used:** Presentation slides, Benefits Ladder template

**Differentiation:** Provide industry-specific examples for different professional backgrounds

**Technology Integration:** Use screen sharing and annotation tools to highlight key concepts

### Elaborate
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Facilitate a workshop where learners develop a complete Benefits Ladder for their case study product or service.

**Resources Used:** Benefits Ladder template, customer persona templates

**Differentiation:** Provide coaching and additional examples for groups that are struggling

**Technology Integration:** Use project management tools to track progress and facilitate collaboration

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide a peer review process where groups evaluate each other's Benefits Ladders.

**Learner Activities:** Present Benefits Ladders to peers, provide constructive feedback, and reflect on their own work.

**Resources Used:** Evaluation rubric, peer feedback forms

**Differentiation:** Adjust evaluation criteria based on professional experience levels

**Technology Integration:** Use digital forms for structured peer feedback and self-reflection

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Observation of group discussions and collaborative work during Explore and Elaborate phases
  - Alignment: Assesses ability to analyze attributes and customer needs in a professional context
* **Summative**: Quality and effectiveness of the final Benefits Ladder created for the case study
  - Alignment: Evaluates ability to synthesize functional benefits and create a compelling value proposition
* **Summative**: Individual reflection paper on how to apply the Benefits Ladder approach in their own organization
  - Alignment: Assesses understanding of real-world application and strategic thinking

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice professionals**: Provide more structured templates, additional examples, and guided practice sessions
* **Experienced professionals**: Offer more complex case studies, encourage mentoring of less experienced peers, and focus on advanced applications

## Cross-Disciplinary Connections
* Product development: Understanding how design decisions impact functional benefits
* Customer service: Insights into real customer needs and pain points
* Sales: Translating Benefits Ladders into effective sales pitches
* Data analytics: Using customer data to validate and refine benefit statements

## Real-World Applications
* Developing marketing campaigns that highlight key functional benefits
* Refining product development roadmaps based on identified customer needs
* Creating more effective sales presentations and proposals
* Improving customer onboarding processes by focusing on key functional benefits

## Metacognition Opportunities
* Reflection on personal biases in assuming customer needs
