### Explore
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Introduce the three models (Value Staircase, Value Pyramid, Benefits Ladder) and guide learners through a comparative analysis.

**Learner Activities:** In groups, map out each model for the example product and identify potential overlaps and complementarities.

**Resources Used:** Model handouts, collaborative mapping tools

**Differentiation:** Provide pre-filled templates for groups needing additional support

**Technology Integration:** Use a digital mind-mapping tool for collaborative model analysis

### Explain
**Duration:** 45 minutes
