## Lesson Structure
### Engage
**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present a real-world case of a failed product due to misalignment with customer value. Facilitate a discussion on potential causes and the role of value understanding in product development.

**Learner Activities:** Participate in group discussion, share personal experiences with product successes or failures related to value alignment.

**Resources Used:** Case study presentation, discussion prompts

**Differentiation:** Provide additional context for less experienced professionals, encourage leadership from more experienced participants

**Technology Integration:** Use digital polling for initial thoughts on case study causes

### Explore
**Duration:** 60 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide learners through an exploration of the Value Staircase, Value Pyramid, and Benefits Ladder models. Provide examples of how these models apply to product development.

**Learner Activities:** In small groups, apply each model to a given product scenario, identifying potential value propositions and benefits.

**Resources Used:** Model descriptions, product scenario cards

**Differentiation:** Provide simplified scenarios for novices, complex scenarios for experienced professionals

**Technology Integration:** Use collaborative digital workspaces for group model application

### Explain
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present strategies for integrating value models into different stages of product development. Discuss the importance of cross-functional collaboration.

**Learner Activities:** Take notes, ask questions, and participate in discussions on how these strategies could be applied in their organizations.

**Resources Used:** Presentation slides, integration strategy checklist

**Differentiation:** Provide industry-specific examples to cater to diverse professional backgrounds

**Technology Integration:** Use interactive presentation software with embedded quizzes

### Elaborate
**Duration:** 90 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Facilitate a hands-on workshop where learners develop an integration plan for value models in a product development cycle.

**Learner Activities:** Work in cross-functional teams to create a value-driven product development plan, including strategies for each stage of development.

**Resources Used:** Product development cycle template, value model integration guidelines

**Differentiation:** Assign roles based on professional experience, provide coaching as needed

**Technology Integration:** Use project management tools to create and share integration plans

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide teams in presenting their integration plans. Facilitate peer feedback and discussion on the potential impact of these plans.

**Learner Activities:** Present integration plans, provide constructive feedback to other teams, reflect on learning and application to own work context.

**Resources Used:** Evaluation rubric, peer feedback forms

**Differentiation:** Adjust presentation expectations based on team composition and experience levels

**Technology Integration:** Use virtual presentation tools with interactive feedback features

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Observation of group discussions and model application exercises
  - Alignment: Assesses understanding and application of value models in product contexts
* **Summative**: Evaluation of final integration plan presentations
  - Alignment: Assesses ability to synthesize learning into a comprehensive strategy aligned with professional practice
* **Summative**: Individual reflection paper on applying lesson content to own organization
  - Alignment: Evaluates ability to transfer learning to specific professional contexts

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice product professionals**: Provide additional guidance on product development stages, offer simplified scenarios for practice
* **Experienced managers**: Encourage leadership in group activities, provide complex scenarios that require strategic thinking
* **Industry-specific roles**: Offer tailored examples and case studies relevant to specific industries represented in the class

## Cross-Disciplinary Connections

* Explore connections with agile project management methodologies
* Discuss implications for data analytics and market research

## Real-World Applications
* Applying value models to ongoing product development projects
* Using integration strategies to improve cross-functional collaboration in organizations
* Enhancing product pitches and marketing strategies based on value model insights

## Metacognition Opportunities
* Reflect on past product development experiences through the lens of value models
* Consider how personal biases might affect value perception in product development
* Identify areas for professional growth in value-driven product management

## Extension Activities
* Conduct a value model audit of a current product in development
* Create a value-driven product development playbook for their organization
* Organize a cross-functional workshop to apply value models to a real product challenge

## Safety Considerations
* Ensure confidentiality when discussing specific organizational practices
* Address potential conflicts arising from different professional perspectives

## Reflection Questions
### For Learners
* How can you immediately apply value model integration in your current role?
* What challenges do you anticipate in implementing these strategies, and how might you overcome them?
* How does this approach to product development align with or challenge your organization's current practices?

### For Facilitator
