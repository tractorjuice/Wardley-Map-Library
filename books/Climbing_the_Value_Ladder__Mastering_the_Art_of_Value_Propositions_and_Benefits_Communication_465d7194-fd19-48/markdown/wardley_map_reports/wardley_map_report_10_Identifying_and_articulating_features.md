## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the landscape of feature identification and articulation across different stages of market evolution, from customer needs to value proposition development.

**Anchor:** The anchor is 'Customer Needs', positioned at [0.95, 0.78]. It represents the primary driver for all subsequent activities in feature identification and articulation, emphasizing the customer-centric approach in product development.

## Component Analysis

### Customer Needs

- **Position:** Positioned at [0.95, 0.78], indicating high visibility and maturity
- **Evolution Stage:** Mature, with inertia
- **Strategic Significance:** Fundamental driver of all product development activities, crucial for aligning features with market demands

### Market Research

- **Position:** Located at [0.82, 0.69], suggesting high visibility but less maturity than Customer Needs
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built to Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for understanding market trends and informing feature decisions

### Feature Identification

- **Position:** Positioned at [0.68, 0.59], indicating moderate visibility and evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Product to Rental
- **Strategic Significance:** Key process for determining which features to develop, balancing customer needs and market trends

### Wardley Mapping

- **Position:** Located at [0.45, 0.41], suggesting lower visibility and evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Concept to Custom-built, with potential for rapid evolution
- **Strategic Significance:** Emerging tool for strategic analysis, potentially transformative for feature identification and prioritization

### Value Staircase

- **Position:** Positioned at [0.35, 0.33], indicating low visibility and evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Concept to Custom-built, with potential for evolution
- **Strategic Significance:** Crucial for structuring and communicating feature value, key to effective product positioning

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a clear progression from customer-centric components (high visibility, high evolution) to more specialized strategic tools (lower visibility, lower evolution). This suggests an industry in transition, moving towards more sophisticated feature identification and articulation methods.

### Key Evolving Components
- Wardley Mapping
- Feature Hierarchy
- Value Staircase

### Disruption Risks
- Commoditized Features
- Traditional Market Research methods

## Value Chain Analysis

Value flows from Customer Needs through Market Research and Competitor Analysis to Feature Identification, then to Feature Articulation, and finally to the Value Staircase. Each step adds refinement and strategic value to the feature development process.

### Critical Paths
