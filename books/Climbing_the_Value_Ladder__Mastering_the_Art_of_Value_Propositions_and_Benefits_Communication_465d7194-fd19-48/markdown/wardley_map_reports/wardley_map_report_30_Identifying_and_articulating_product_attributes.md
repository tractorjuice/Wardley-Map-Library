## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the journey of identifying and articulating product attributes in the context of public sector digital transformation. It shows the evolution from generic to specific to valuable product attributes, and their relationship with public sector needs, government objectives, and citizen services.

**Anchor:** The anchor appears to be 'Public Sector Needs', 'Government Objectives', and 'Citizen Services', representing the ultimate user needs that drive the entire value chain. These components are positioned high on the value chain and towards the right, indicating their visibility and importance to end-users.

## Component Analysis

### Generic Product Attributes

- **Position:** High visibility, high evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+commodity)
- **Strategic Significance:** Foundational but commoditized; focus should be on moving beyond these to create differentiation.

### Specific Product Attributes

- **Position:** Mid visibility, mid-high evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for differentiation; requires focused development to move towards valuable attributes.

### Valuable Product Attributes

- **Position:** Lower visibility, mid evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Highly strategic; directly contributes to meeting public sector needs and objectives.

### Cross-functional Collaboration

- **Position:** Low visibility, low evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis
- **Strategic Significance:** Key for developing specific and valuable attributes; potential area for innovation and improvement.

## Evolution Analysis
