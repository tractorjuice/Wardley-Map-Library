## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the integration of three value communication models: Value Staircase, Value Pyramid, and Benefits Ladder. It shows how these models interact and contribute to a holistic value proposition and stakeholder resonance.

**Anchor:** The anchor appears to be 'Value Communication' at [0.95, 0.63], representing the core need to effectively communicate value to stakeholders.

## Component Analysis

### Value Communication

- **Position:** High visibility (0.95) and custom-built (0.63)
- **Evolution Stage:** Late Product (+) stage, evolving towards Commodity
- **Strategic Significance:** Central to the entire system, driving the integration of various value models

### Holistic Value Proposition

- **Position:** High visibility (0.80) and product (0.75)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product stage, evolving towards Commodity
- **Strategic Significance:** Key output of the integrated models, crucial for effective stakeholder communication

### Stakeholder Resonance

- **Position:** High visibility (0.85) and concept (0.90)
- **Evolution Stage:** Early Product stage
- **Strategic Significance:** Ultimate goal of value communication, indicating successful integration and application of the models

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a system evolving from basic product attributes towards more sophisticated and impactful value communication.
