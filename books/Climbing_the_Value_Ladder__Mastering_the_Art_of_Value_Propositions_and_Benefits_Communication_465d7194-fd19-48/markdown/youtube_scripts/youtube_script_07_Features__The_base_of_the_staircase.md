Welcome to our series on mastering value propositions! Today, we're starting at the ground floor of the Value Staircase: Features. These are the building blocks that support everything else in your value communication. So, let's dive in and discover why features are so crucial and how to use them effectively!

First, let's define what we mean by features. Features are the tangible and intangible characteristics of your product or service. They're the facts, the specifications, the 'what it is' and 'what it does'. Think of them as the DNA of your offering. Let's break down the types of features we typically see:

1. Specifications: Technical details, dimensions, materials used
2. Functionalities: What the product or service can do
3. Components: The parts or elements that make up the offering
4. Performance metrics: Quantifiable measures of capability
5. Design elements: Visual or structural aspects of the offering

Can you think of a product you use daily? What features does it have?

Now, let's talk about why features are so important in value communication. Features form the foundation of your value proposition. They're especially crucial in government and enterprise contexts, where detailed specifications are often required. But remember, features alone aren't enough - it's how you present them that matters.

How might the importance of features differ between consumer products and government contracts?

To make your features shine, consider these strategies:
1. Prioritize the most relevant features for your audience
2. Contextualize them within your client's needs
3. Highlight what makes you unique
4. Show how your features can scale
5. Align with compliance requirements

Let's look at a practical example. Imagine you're presenting a cloud storage solution to a government agency. Instead of just listing storage capacity and security protocols, you might prioritize features that address data sovereignty concerns, highlight scalability to meet future needs, and demonstrate compliance with specific government regulations.

Which of these strategies do you think would be most effective in your industry?

Now, let's talk about an advanced technique for understanding and communicating features: Wardley Mapping. This powerful tool helps visualize how features relate to each other and to the overall value chain. Let's take a quick look at how this works.

Imagine mapping out the features of our cloud storage solution. We might place basic storage at the bottom as a commodity, with more advanced features like AI-powered search or blockchain verification higher up. This visual representation can reveal opportunities for innovation and help prioritize development efforts.

How might mapping your features this way change your perspective on your offering?

Let's wrap up with some key takeaways:
1. Features are the tangible and intangible characteristics of your offering
2. Effective feature communication goes beyond listing specifications
3. Strategic presentation of features sets the stage for higher-level value discussions
4. Features are crucial in government and enterprise contexts
5. Tools like Wardley Mapping can enhance feature communication

Remember, features are the foundation of your value proposition, but they're just the beginning. By understanding how to effectively communicate your features, you're setting the stage for a compelling value narrative. Remember, each feature is a potential springboard to higher levels of value communication.
