- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+commodity)
- **Strategic Significance:** While still prevalent, it's evolving towards obsolescence as circular approaches gain traction.

### Recycling

- **Position:** High visibility (0.65), moderate evolution (0.65)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** A key transitional step between linear and circular models, with room for further evolution.

### Design for Circularity

- **Position:** Low visibility (0.25), moderate evolution (0.45)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** A critical component for enabling true circular economy, with significant potential for impact as it evolves.

### AI-Powered Sorting

- **Position:** Low visibility (0.20), low evolution (0.15)
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis
- **Strategic Significance:** An emerging technology with high potential to revolutionize resource recovery and recycling efficiency.
