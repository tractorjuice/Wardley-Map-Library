## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the evolution of waste management practices from traditional linear approaches towards a circular economy model, incorporating natural nutrient cycles and soil fertility concepts.

**Anchor:** The anchor appears to be 'Waste Management Awareness', positioned as a market element. This signifies that public understanding and demand for better waste management practices are driving the evolution of the entire system.

## Component Analysis

### Landfills

- **Position:** High visibility, low value
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+commodity)
- **Strategic Significance:** Legacy approach with high inertia, likely to be phased out over time

### Circular Economy Principles

- **Position:** Low visibility, high value
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Key driver of future waste management practices, influencing multiple downstream components

### Natural Nutrient Cycles

- **Position:** Low visibility, highest value
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis
- **Strategic Significance:** Foundational concept informing circular economy principles and regenerative practices

### Smart Waste Management

- **Position:** Low visibility, high value
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Emerging technology-driven approach with potential for significant impact on efficiency and sustainability

## Evolution Analysis
