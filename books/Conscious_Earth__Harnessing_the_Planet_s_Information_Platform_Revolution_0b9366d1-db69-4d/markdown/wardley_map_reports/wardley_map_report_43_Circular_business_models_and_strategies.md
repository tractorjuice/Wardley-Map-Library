## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the transition from traditional linear supply chains to circular supply chains in government procurement, highlighting various components of circular economy principles and their relationships.

**Anchor:** The anchor is 'User Needs', positioned at high value and high visibility. This signifies that meeting user needs is the primary driver for government procurement strategies and the shift towards circular economy models.

## Component Analysis

### Government Procurement

- **Position:** High value, moving from Product to Commodity
- **Evolution Stage:** Late Product / Early Commodity
- **Strategic Significance:** Central to driving the shift from linear to circular supply chains, with significant influence over other components.

### Traditional Linear Supply Chain

- **Position:** Mid-value, mid-evolution with inertia
- **Evolution Stage:** Late Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Represents the status quo, with inherent resistance to change, but evolving towards circular models.

### Circular Supply Chain

- **Position:** High value, early evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Early Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Key strategic focus, driving multiple sub-components and representing the future of sustainable procurement.

### AI-Powered Sorting Systems

- **Position:** Low value, high evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Early Commodity
- **Strategic Significance:** Emerging technology with potential to significantly enhance resource recovery and recycling efficiency.
