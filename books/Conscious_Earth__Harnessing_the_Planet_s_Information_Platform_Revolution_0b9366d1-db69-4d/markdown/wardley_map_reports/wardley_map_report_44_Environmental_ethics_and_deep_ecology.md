## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the evolution of ethical frameworks and technologies related to Earth stewardship, ranging from basic resource management to advanced conscious Earth technologies.

**Anchor:** The anchor appears to be 'Ethical Considerations', represented by the pipeline at the bottom of the map. This signifies that the entire system is driven by the need to develop and implement ethical approaches to managing Earth's resources and ecosystems.

## Component Analysis

### Basic Resource Management

- **Position:** High value chain, high evolution (0.75, 0.85)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+commodity)
- **Strategic Significance:** Foundational but commoditized; limited strategic value

### Environmental Ethics

- **Position:** Mid-high value chain, high evolution (0.60, 0.70)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical bridge between basic management and advanced approaches

### Deep Ecology

- **Position:** Mid value chain, mid evolution (0.45, 0.55)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Key differentiator and driver of advanced ethical frameworks

### Conscious Earth Technologies

- **Position:** Low value chain, low evolution (0.20, 0.25)
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis
- **Strategic Significance:** Highly innovative, potential for significant future impact
