## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the Open Source Initiative's (OSI) transition from traditional software to AI systems, highlighting the evolving landscape of open source definitions, components, and challenges.

**Anchor:** The anchor appears to be the Open Source Definition, positioned high on the value chain and relatively evolved. This signifies its crucial role in guiding the entire open source ecosystem, including emerging AI technologies.

## Component Analysis

### Open Source Definition

- **Position:** High value, high evolution (0.75, 0.90)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+commodity)
- **Strategic Significance:** Core to OSI's mission, but facing pressure to evolve with AI advancements

### Open Source AI Definition

- **Position:** High value, low evolution (0.20, 0.80)
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for future relevance, requires rapid development

### AI Systems

- **Position:** Medium value, low evolution (0.30, 0.50)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Key area for OSI to influence and shape open source practices

### Ethical Considerations

- **Position:** High value, very low evolution (0.15, 0.70)
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis
- **Strategic Significance:** Crucial for responsible AI development, needs significant attention
