## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the evolution of community-driven data ecosystems for open source AI, showcasing the interplay between various components from governance to AI models.

**Anchor:** The anchor is the Open Source AI Community, representing the primary user need. It's significant as it drives the entire ecosystem and determines the value of other components.

## Component Analysis

### Governance Frameworks

- **Position:** High value, low evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for establishing trust and standards in the ecosystem

### Data Contribution Platforms

- **Position:** Mid-value, mid-evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Key enabler for community participation and data accumulation

### Data Validation Mechanisms

- **Position:** Mid-value, mid-evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Ensures data quality and reliability, critical for AI model performance

### AI Models

- **Position:** High value, low-mid evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built to Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Core output of the ecosystem, driving innovation and application
