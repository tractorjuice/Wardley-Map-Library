## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the ecosystem for global AI collaboration, showcasing various components from research hubs to governance frameworks.

**Anchor:** The map doesn't explicitly show a user need, but 'Global Challenges' and 'AI Developers' at the top suggest these are the primary beneficiaries or drivers of the ecosystem.

## Component Analysis

### AI Research Hubs

- **Position:** High value, high evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+commodity)
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for driving innovation and knowledge creation in AI

### Open Source AI

- **Position:** High value, evolving towards product
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built (moving to product)
- **Strategic Significance:** Key for democratizing AI development and fostering collaboration

### Data Sharing Frameworks

- **Position:** Mid-value, mid-evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Essential for enabling collaborative AI development and research

### AI Governance Frameworks

- **Position:** Lower value, lower evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis (moving to custom-built)
- **Strategic Significance:** Crucial for ensuring ethical and responsible AI development

## Evolution Analysis

The ecosystem shows a mix of evolving components, with research and data aspects more evolved than governance and ethical frameworks.

### Key Evolving Components
