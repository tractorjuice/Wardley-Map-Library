#### <a id="111-the-increasing-demand-for-timely-and-granular-data"></a>1.1.1 The Increasing Demand for Timely and Granular Data

The role of official statistics is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by an ever-increasing demand for data that is not only accurate but also timely and granular. This demand stems from a variety of sources, including governments seeking to make evidence-based policy decisions, businesses looking to understand market trends, and citizens wanting to hold their leaders accountable. Meeting this demand is crucial for the UN Statistics Division (UNSD) to maintain its relevance and effectiveness in the 21st century. The ability to provide insights at a more detailed level and with greater speed is no longer a luxury but a necessity for informed decision-making across all sectors.

The need for timely data has been amplified by recent global events. The COVID-19 pandemic, for example, highlighted the critical importance of real-time data for tracking the spread of the virus, assessing the impact on economies and societies, and implementing effective public health measures. This experience underscored the limitations of traditional statistical production systems, which often rely on data collection and processing methods that are too slow to keep pace with rapidly changing circumstances. As a senior government official noted, The pandemic exposed the fragility of our existing statistical infrastructure and the urgent need for more agile and responsive data systems.

Granular data, referring to data broken down into its finest, most detailed parts that are still usable, is equally important. It allows for a deeper understanding of complex phenomena and enables more targeted interventions. For instance, instead of simply knowing the overall unemployment rate, policymakers need granular data on unemployment rates by age, gender, education level, and geographic location to design effective employment programs. Similarly, businesses need granular data on consumer behaviour to tailor their products and services to specific market segments. Granularity allows for more in-depth analysis and precise audience targeting.

- **For Regulators:** Granular data leads to faster results, reduces the burden of data reporting, improves accuracy and insights, and provides greater flexibility to reuse data for different insights. It also supports better supervision through increased data visibility, enabling early identification of potential risks.
- **Generally:** It allows for more in-depth analysis and precise audience targeting. For example, instead of just knowing the number of website purchases, you can segment customers by purchase frequency, income, or lifestyle.

Several efforts are underway to meet this increasing demand for timely and granular data. National and international organisations are exploring innovative methodologies, leveraging new data sources, utilising statistical registers, and adopting advanced technologies. These efforts include tapping into citizen-generated data, geospatial data, and Big Data sources such as satellite imagery, mobile phone data, scanner data, and social media data. Collaboration with other actors, including the media and fact-checkers, is also becoming increasingly important. Furthermore, modernising legal frameworks to embrace new data sources and technologies in ethical and privacy-preserving ways is essential.

However, significant challenges remain. Many countries have outdated statistics laws that limit the scope of statistical production and impede the use of new data sources. Legacy systems, designed for traditional data collection and processing methods, are often ill-equipped to handle the volume and velocity of modern data streams. Resource constraints also pose a major obstacle, as statistical agencies struggle to produce more data with potentially declining purchasing power due to inflation. As a leading expert in the field observed, The challenge is not just about collecting more data, but about transforming the entire statistical production process to be more agile, efficient, and responsive to user needs.

The increasing demand for timely and granular data presents both a challenge and an opportunity for the UNSD. By embracing innovative technologies like GenAI, the UNSD can transform its statistical production processes, enhance data quality, and provide policymakers and citizens with the insights they need to address the complex challenges of the 21st century. Failing to adapt to this changing landscape risks marginalising the role of official statistics and undermining the credibility of evidence-based decision-making. The subsequent sections will explore how GenAI can be leveraged to overcome these challenges and unlock the full potential of official statistics.



#### <a id="112-challenges-in-traditional-statistical-production"></a>1.1.2 Challenges in Traditional Statistical Production

Traditional statistical production, while foundational, faces significant hurdles in meeting the evolving demands outlined in the previous section. These challenges stem from outdated methodologies, rigid organisational structures, and increasing resource constraints. Overcoming these obstacles is crucial for the UN Statistics Division (UNSD) to remain a relevant and reliable source of information in a rapidly changing world. The rise of alternative data sources and the need for agility demand a fundamental re-evaluation of existing statistical processes.

One of the primary challenges is the reliance on traditional data collection methods, such as surveys and censuses. These methods are often time-consuming, expensive, and prone to errors. The process of designing questionnaires, collecting data, processing responses, and disseminating results can take months, if not years. This delay can render the data obsolete by the time it becomes available, particularly in rapidly evolving fields such as technology and economics. Furthermore, traditional surveys often suffer from low response rates, leading to biased samples and inaccurate estimates. As a senior statistician noted, The inherent lag in traditional statistical production makes it difficult to capture real-time trends and inform timely policy decisions.

Another significant challenge is the siloed nature of many statistical organisations. Data is often collected and processed by different departments or agencies, with limited coordination or data sharing. This lack of integration can lead to duplication of effort, inconsistencies in data definitions, and a fragmented view of the overall statistical landscape. The UN Statistics Division itself, while playing a coordinating role, still relies on data provided by individual member states, which may vary significantly in terms of quality, timeliness, and methodology. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to produce comparable statistics across countries and regions.

Resource constraints also pose a major obstacle to traditional statistical production. Many national statistical offices (NSOs) face budget cuts, staffing shortages, and a lack of investment in modern technology. This limits their ability to collect, process, and disseminate data effectively. The increasing complexity of the global economy and society requires new statistical skills and expertise, but many NSOs struggle to attract and retain qualified personnel. The rise of new data sources, such as big data and citizen-generated data, presents both an opportunity and a challenge. While these sources offer the potential to complement traditional statistics, they also require new analytical tools and techniques, which many NSOs lack. The UN Statistics Division is aware of the challenges to traditional statistical production and is taking steps to address them. These challenges include the data revolution, the need for speed, new data sources, adapting to change, and maintaining principles.

- Professional independence
- Access to sources
- Impartiality

Furthermore, maintaining data quality in the face of these challenges is paramount. Traditional statistical methods rely on well-defined sampling frames, rigorous data validation procedures, and established quality control mechanisms. However, many new data sources lack these features, making it difficult to assess their accuracy and reliability. The use of algorithms and machine learning techniques in statistical production also raises concerns about transparency and explainability. It is essential to ensure that statistical processes are not only accurate but also transparent and understandable to users. As a leading expert in data governance stated, Trust in official statistics depends on the ability to demonstrate the quality and integrity of the data and the methods used to produce it.

The UN Statistics Division is actively working to address these challenges. It is drafting a new edition of the Handbook of Statistical Organization to support senior managers in adapting and developing their statistical organizations and systems. The UN is also promoting the use of non-traditional data sources, developing guidelines and frameworks to help NSOs incorporate new data sources while adhering to the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics, and supporting countries in managing crises. These efforts aim to modernise statistical production processes, enhance data quality, and improve the relevance and timeliness of official statistics.

In summary, the challenges facing traditional statistical production are multifaceted and require a comprehensive approach. By embracing innovative technologies like GenAI, the UNSD can overcome these obstacles and transform its statistical production processes to meet the evolving needs of the 21st century. The following sections will explore how GenAI can be leveraged to address these specific challenges and unlock the full potential of official statistics.



#### <a id="113-the-potential-of-genai-to-transform-official-statistics"></a>1.1.3 The Potential of GenAI to Transform Official Statistics

Building upon the identified challenges in traditional statistical production and the increasing demand for timely and granular data, Generative AI (GenAI) presents a transformative opportunity for the UN Statistics Division (UNSD). GenAI's ability to automate tasks, generate insights, and enhance data quality can revolutionise the way official statistics are produced, disseminated, and used. This section will explore the potential of GenAI to address the specific pain points of traditional statistical production and unlock new possibilities for data-driven decision-making.

One of the most significant potentials of GenAI lies in its ability to automate data collection and processing. As previously discussed, traditional surveys and censuses are time-consuming and expensive. GenAI can be used to design more efficient questionnaires, optimise data collection strategies, and automate data entry and validation. For instance, GenAI models can analyse open-ended survey responses to identify key themes and patterns, reducing the need for manual coding and analysis. Similarly, GenAI can be used to automatically extract information from unstructured data sources, such as satellite imagery and social media feeds, providing real-time insights into economic and social trends.

GenAI can also enhance data quality and completeness. Data imputation, a technique for filling in missing values, can be significantly improved using GenAI models. Instead of relying on simple statistical methods, GenAI can learn complex patterns from existing data to generate more accurate and realistic imputations. Anomaly detection, another crucial aspect of data quality control, can also benefit from GenAI. By training models on historical data, GenAI can identify outliers and errors that would be difficult to detect using traditional methods. Furthermore, GenAI can be used to harmonise data from diverse sources, addressing the challenge of data silos and inconsistencies.

The acceleration of statistical production is another key benefit of GenAI. Automated report generation can significantly reduce the time and effort required to produce statistical reports. GenAI models can be trained to generate reports from structured data, incorporating text, tables, and charts. Text summarisation techniques can be used to condense large volumes of textual data, providing policymakers and citizens with concise and accessible summaries of key findings. Data augmentation, the generation of synthetic data, can be used to supplement existing datasets, particularly in areas where data is scarce or sensitive. This is especially useful for training machine learning models and conducting statistical analysis.

Beyond improving efficiency and data quality, GenAI can also enhance data accessibility and user interaction. New approaches to data accessibility and user interaction in statistical data management and exchange are being explored, leveraging GenAI to make data more understandable and usable for a wider audience. This includes developing interactive dashboards, chatbots, and other tools that allow users to explore data and generate custom reports. The potential of GenAI to translate documents can also improve accessibility for non-English speakers, promoting greater inclusivity and participation.

However, it is crucial to acknowledge the risks associated with GenAI, as highlighted in the external knowledge. Reliability, traceability, transparency, robustness, security, safety, accountability, ethics, and privacy are all critical considerations. Mitigation strategies, such as monitoring and evaluating the use of GenAI in official statistics, are essential to ensure responsible and ethical implementation. The building blocks for successful GenAI implementation include data, technology, governance, skills, cultural aspects, and legal frameworks. Sharing data, tools, and knowledge is also crucial to mature the use of GenAI within the UNSD and the broader statistical community.

The UN Statistics Division can draw inspiration from initiatives and projects already underway. StatGPT 2.0, a GenAI application for global economic data developed by EPAM in collaboration with the IMF, demonstrates the potential of GenAI to provide timely and accessible economic insights. The Data Science Leaders Network (DSLN) and the United Nations Network of Economic Statisticians are organising sprints focused on enhancing NSOs' capabilities in leveraging AI and data science for economic statistics, including generative AI applications. These initiatives highlight the growing recognition of GenAI's potential within the statistical community.

In conclusion, GenAI offers a powerful set of tools and techniques that can transform official statistics. By automating tasks, enhancing data quality, accelerating production, and improving accessibility, GenAI can help the UNSD meet the increasing demand for timely and granular data. However, it is essential to address the risks associated with GenAI and ensure responsible and ethical implementation. The following chapters will delve deeper into the ethical considerations, practical applications, infrastructure requirements, and impact measurement of GenAI in official statistics.



### <a id="12-the-un-statistics-division-mandate-operations-and-data-ecosystem"></a>1.2 The UN Statistics Division: Mandate, Operations, and Data Ecosystem

#### <a id="121-unsds-role-in-global-statistical-standards-and-coordination"></a>1.2.1 UNSD's Role in Global Statistical Standards and Coordination

The United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) stands as a cornerstone in the global statistical ecosystem, playing a pivotal role in establishing and coordinating statistical standards across nations. This function is critical for ensuring that data collected worldwide is comparable, reliable, and suitable for international analysis and decision-making. In the context of an evolving data landscape and the emergence of GenAI, the UNSD's role in standardisation and coordination becomes even more crucial, ensuring that these new technologies are integrated responsibly and effectively into official statistics.

The UNSD's mandate encompasses several key areas, each contributing to the harmonisation of statistical practices globally. These include:

- **Development of Standards and Norms:** The UNSD develops statistical standards and norms for various statistical activities, providing a framework for countries to follow in their data collection and processing efforts. This ensures consistency and comparability across different datasets.
- **Coordination of International Activities:** It facilitates the coordination of international statistical programs and activities, preventing duplication of effort and promoting collaboration among different organisations. This is particularly important in areas such as Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) monitoring, where data from multiple sources needs to be integrated.
- **Support to the UN Statistical Commission:** The UNSD supports the functioning of the UN Statistical Commission, which is the highest decision-making body for coordinating international statistical activities. This ensures that statistical standards are aligned with the needs of policymakers and other stakeholders.
- **Assistance to Countries:** The UNSD assists countries in implementing statistical standards and strengthens their national statistical systems. This includes providing technical assistance, training, and capacity building to help countries improve their statistical capabilities.
- **Data Collection and Dissemination:** The UNSD collects, processes, and disseminates global statistical information across a broad range of statistical domains. This provides a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and the public.
- **Collaboration:** UNSD Cooperates with international, regional, and supranational agencies in the work on statistical standards, data collection, and statistical capacity building. This collaborative approach ensures that statistical standards are developed and implemented in a coordinated and effective manner.

The importance of harmonised statistical methods, classifications, and definitions cannot be overstated. Without these standards, data collected in different countries would be difficult, if not impossible, to compare. This would hinder international analysis and decision-making, particularly in areas such as trade, development, and environmental protection. As a leading expert in international statistics noted, Without common standards, we are essentially speaking different languages, making it impossible to have a meaningful conversation about global issues.

In the context of GenAI, the UNSD's role in standardisation and coordination takes on a new dimension. As GenAI models become increasingly sophisticated and are used to generate statistical insights, it is crucial to ensure that these models are trained on high-quality, comparable data. The UNSD can play a key role in developing standards for data quality, metadata, and model documentation, ensuring that GenAI applications are reliable and trustworthy. Furthermore, the UNSD can facilitate the sharing of best practices and lessons learned among countries, promoting the responsible and ethical use of GenAI in official statistics.

Consider the challenge of using GenAI to impute missing values in national accounts data. If different countries use different methods for collecting and processing their national accounts data, it may be difficult to train a GenAI model that can accurately impute missing values across all countries. The UNSD can help to address this challenge by developing standards for national accounts data collection and processing, ensuring that the data is comparable across countries. This would enable the development of more robust and reliable GenAI models for data imputation.

The UNSD's efforts to modernise statistical production processes, as mentioned in the previous section, are also critical in the context of GenAI. By promoting the use of new data sources and technologies, the UNSD can help countries to leverage the full potential of GenAI. However, it is essential to ensure that these new data sources and technologies are used in a way that is consistent with the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics, particularly those related to professional independence, impartiality, and access to sources. The UNSD can play a key role in developing guidelines and frameworks to help countries navigate these challenges.

In conclusion, the UNSD's role in global statistical standards and coordination is essential for ensuring the quality, comparability, and reliability of official statistics. In the age of GenAI, this role becomes even more critical, as the UNSD can help to ensure that these new technologies are used responsibly and effectively to enhance statistical production and inform evidence-based decision-making. By promoting standardisation, coordination, and collaboration, the UNSD can help to unlock the full potential of GenAI for the benefit of all.

This section outlines key pain points and corresponding opportunities for GenAI implementation, building upon the discussion of the UNSD's mandate, operations, and data collection, processing, and dissemination methods.

One significant pain point is the **time lag in data production**. As previously mentioned, traditional statistical methods can be slow and resource-intensive. GenAI offers the opportunity to accelerate data collection, processing, and dissemination, providing more timely insights for policymakers and other stakeholders. For example, GenAI can automate the extraction of information from unstructured data sources, such as news articles and social media feeds, providing real-time indicators of economic and social trends. This aligns with the increasing demand for timely data, as discussed earlier.

Another challenge is **data quality and completeness**. Missing values, errors, and inconsistencies can compromise the accuracy and reliability of official statistics. GenAI can be used to improve data imputation, anomaly detection, and data harmonisation, enhancing the overall quality of the data. For instance, GenAI models can be trained to identify and correct errors in survey responses, reducing the need for manual data cleaning. This directly addresses the need to maintain data quality in the face of evolving data sources and methodologies.

The **lack of granular data** is a further pain point. Policymakers often require data at a detailed level to design effective interventions. GenAI can be used to disaggregate data and generate synthetic data, providing more granular insights without compromising data privacy. For example, GenAI can be used to create small-area estimates of poverty rates, providing policymakers with detailed information on poverty levels at the local level. This aligns with the increasing demand for granular data, enabling more targeted and effective policy decisions.

Furthermore, **data accessibility and usability** can be improved. Official statistics are often difficult for non-experts to understand and use. GenAI can be used to create more user-friendly data visualisations, interactive dashboards, and chatbots, making data more accessible to a wider audience. For example, GenAI can be used to generate automated summaries of statistical reports, providing policymakers and citizens with concise and accessible overviews of key findings.

A critical pain point lies in **resource constraints**. Many NSOs face budget cuts and staffing shortages, limiting their ability to produce high-quality statistics. GenAI can automate many of the manual tasks involved in statistical production, freeing up resources for more strategic activities. For example, GenAI can be used to automate the generation of statistical reports, reducing the time and effort required to produce these reports manually.

The **siloed nature of data** within and across organisations presents another challenge. GenAI can facilitate data sharing and integration, breaking down data silos and promoting a more holistic view of the statistical landscape. For example, GenAI can be used to harmonise data from different sources, making it easier to integrate data from different departments or agencies.

- **Risk of Duplication:** GenAI can help identify and eliminate redundant efforts across UN agencies.
- **Need for Interdisciplinary Approaches:** GenAI can facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing between different disciplines.
- **Ethical Considerations:** GenAI can be used to develop and implement ethical guidelines for AI development and deployment.
- **Data Quality and Bias:** GenAI can be used to identify and mitigate bias in datasets.
- **Privacy and Security:** GenAI can be used to enhance data privacy and security.
- **Lack of Unified Framework:** GenAI can be used to develop a unified framework for inclusive GenAI development.
- **Misinformation and Stereotyping:** GenAI can be used to detect and combat AI-enabled misinformation and stereotyping.
- **Coordination:** GenAI can improve coordination among UN agencies in the context of AI adoption, development, and integration.

Addressing these pain points requires a strategic approach to GenAI implementation, focusing on areas where GenAI can deliver the greatest value. This involves prioritising projects based on their potential impact, feasibility, and alignment with the UNSD's strategic goals. It also requires investing in the necessary infrastructure, skills, and governance frameworks to support GenAI implementation. As a senior government official noted, The key is to focus on the areas where GenAI can make the biggest difference and to ensure that we have the right people, processes, and technologies in place to support its implementation.

In conclusion, identifying pain points and opportunities for improvement is a crucial first step in developing a GenAI strategy for the UNSD. By focusing on areas where GenAI can address specific challenges and deliver tangible benefits, the UNSD can unlock the full potential of GenAI to transform official statistics. The following chapters will delve deeper into the ethical considerations, practical applications, infrastructure requirements, and impact measurement of GenAI in official statistics.

#### <a id="131-defining-generative-ai-models-techniques-and-applications"></a>1.3.1 Defining Generative AI: Models, Techniques, and Applications

Generative AI (GenAI) represents a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, moving beyond traditional analytical and predictive models to systems capable of creating new content. For statisticians at the UN Statistics Division (UNSD), understanding GenAI's core principles, models, and potential applications is crucial for strategically integrating it into official statistics. This section provides a foundational overview of GenAI, setting the stage for exploring its ethical implications, practical use cases, and infrastructure requirements in subsequent chapters. Unlike discriminative AI, which focuses on classifying or predicting data, GenAI aims to learn the underlying patterns and distributions of data to generate new, similar instances.

At its heart, GenAI leverages various models and techniques to achieve its generative capabilities. These models are trained on vast datasets, learning the statistical relationships and structures within the data. Once trained, these models can then be used to generate new data points that resemble the training data. This ability to create new content opens up a wide range of possibilities for official statistics, from data augmentation and imputation to automated report generation and data visualisation. Understanding the nuances of these models is essential for statisticians to effectively apply GenAI to their work.

Several key models and techniques underpin GenAI's capabilities. Large Language Models (LLMs), for instance, are designed to understand and generate human-like text. Diffusion models, inspired by thermodynamics, create data by gradually adding noise to an image and then learning to reverse the process, generating new images from noise. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) involve two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, that compete against each other to produce realistic data. Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, making it important for statisticians to select the appropriate model for a given task.

- **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Excel at generating human-like text, useful for report writing, summarisation, and translation.
- **Diffusion Models:** Generate high-quality images and videos, applicable to satellite image analysis and synthetic data creation.
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** Create realistic data samples, useful for data augmentation and anomaly detection.
- **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** Learn latent representations of data, enabling data compression and generation.

The applications of GenAI in official statistics are diverse and rapidly evolving. As highlighted in the external knowledge, the UN Statistics Division is already exploring GenAI for text creation, document and data analysis, communication and translation, and chatbots. These applications align with the pain points identified in the previous section, such as the need to accelerate statistical production and improve data accessibility. Furthermore, national statistical offices (NSOs) are using AI for tasks such as detecting greenhouses from satellite images and mapping poverty, demonstrating the practical potential of GenAI in the field.

- **Data Imputation:** Filling in missing values in datasets, improving data completeness and accuracy.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identifying outliers and errors in datasets, enhancing data quality control.
- **Data Harmonisation:** Standardising data from diverse sources, facilitating data integration and comparability.
- **Automated Report Generation:** Creating statistical reports from data, accelerating statistical production.
- **Text Summarisation:** Condensing large volumes of textual data, providing concise summaries of key findings.
- **Data Augmentation:** Generating synthetic data for training and analysis, supplementing existing datasets.
- **Translation:** Translating statistical reports and documentation into multiple languages, improving accessibility.

However, it's crucial to acknowledge that GenAI is not a silver bullet. These models have limitations, including the potential for bias, lack of transparency, and the need for large amounts of training data. As a leading expert in the field cautions, GenAI models are only as good as the data they are trained on. If the training data is biased, the model will perpetuate and amplify those biases. Therefore, it is essential to carefully evaluate the strengths and limitations of GenAI before applying it to official statistics.

In conclusion, Generative AI offers a powerful set of tools and techniques that can transform official statistics. By understanding the core principles, models, and applications of GenAI, statisticians at the UNSD can strategically integrate it into their work, addressing key pain points and unlocking new possibilities for data-driven decision-making. However, it is essential to approach GenAI with caution, acknowledging its limitations and ensuring responsible and ethical implementation. The following sections will delve deeper into these considerations, providing a comprehensive roadmap for GenAI adoption at the UNSD.



#### <a id="132-key-concepts-large-language-models-diffusion-models-and-gans"></a>1.3.2 Key Concepts: Large Language Models, Diffusion Models, and GANs

Building upon the foundational understanding of Generative AI (GenAI), it's crucial for statisticians within the UN Statistics Division (UNSD) to delve into the specifics of the core models driving this technology. While GenAI encompasses a range of techniques, Large Language Models (LLMs), Diffusion Models, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) stand out as particularly relevant to the field of official statistics. Each of these models operates on distinct principles and offers unique strengths and weaknesses, influencing their suitability for various applications within the UNSD's data ecosystem. This section will explore these key concepts in detail, providing a practical understanding of their inner workings and potential use cases.

Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a significant advancement in natural language processing. These models, trained on massive datasets of text and code, learn to predict the probability of a sequence of words, enabling them to generate coherent and contextually relevant text. LLMs achieve this by breaking down text into tokens, converting them into numerical representations, and using complex matrix transformations to understand and generate natural language. Their ability to understand and generate human-like text makes them invaluable for tasks such as automated report generation, text summarisation, and translation – all areas where the UNSD could benefit from increased efficiency and accessibility.

- Generating coherent and fluent text.
- Translating languages with increasing accuracy.
- Performing sentiment analysis to understand public opinion.
- Writing code, potentially automating data processing tasks.
- Converting text to images or voice, enhancing data accessibility.

However, LLMs also come with ethical considerations. Biases present in the training data can be reflected in the generated text, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. The potential for misinformation and the misuse of intellectual property are also significant concerns that the UNSD must address when implementing LLMs. As a leading expert in AI ethics notes, It is crucial to carefully curate training data and implement robust safeguards to mitigate the risks of bias and misinformation in LLM applications.

Diffusion Models offer a different approach to generative AI, particularly well-suited for creating high-quality images and videos. These models use an iterative denoising process, starting with a text prompt and generating random noise. They then gradually refine this noise using training data to shape the desired features, effectively learning to reverse the process of adding noise to an image. This technique allows Diffusion Models to capture fine details and complex data structures, making them effective for tasks such as satellite image analysis and synthetic data creation.

- Producing diverse and high-quality samples, especially with complex data.
- Effectively capturing fine details and complex data structures through gradual refinement.
- Generally more stable during training compared to GANs, with less risk of mode collapse.
- Creating photorealistic images and images in various artistic styles.

However, Diffusion Models also have weaknesses. They tend to be slower than GANs due to the iterative denoising process, and they require substantial computational resources because of the multiple training steps involved. Despite these limitations, their ability to generate high-quality images makes them a valuable tool for the UNSD, particularly in areas such as environmental monitoring and disaster response.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) employ a competitive approach to generative AI, using two neural networks – a generator and a discriminator – that compete against each other. The generator creates synthetic data, while the discriminator evaluates its authenticity. Through this adversarial process, the generator learns to produce increasingly realistic data, while the discriminator becomes better at distinguishing between real and synthetic data. GANs are particularly useful for data augmentation and anomaly detection, enhancing the quality and completeness of official statistics.

- Generating highly realistic synthetic content.
- Offering faster sample generation compared to diffusion models.
- Providing more granular control, allowing intervention at specific stages of image generation.
- Producing text, audio, and 3D models in addition to images.
- Being useful for data augmentation and enhancement.

However, GANs are known for their training instability and the risk of mode collapse, where the generator produces limited or repeated samples. These challenges require careful tuning and monitoring during training. Despite these limitations, GANs offer a powerful tool for the UNSD, particularly in areas where data is scarce or sensitive, such as generating synthetic data for training machine learning models.

The choice between LLMs, Diffusion Models, and GANs depends on the specific application and the characteristics of the data. LLMs are best suited for text-based tasks, Diffusion Models for image and video generation, and GANs for data augmentation and anomaly detection. Hybrid models, combining various techniques, can also be used to enhance content generation, merging GANs with diffusion models or integrating LLMs with other neural networks to create more refined and contextually relevant outputs. As a senior data scientist notes, The key is to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each model and to choose the one that best fits the specific needs of the task at hand.

In conclusion, understanding the key concepts behind LLMs, Diffusion Models, and GANs is essential for statisticians at the UNSD to effectively leverage GenAI. By carefully considering the strengths and weaknesses of each model and aligning them with specific applications, the UNSD can unlock the full potential of GenAI to transform official statistics. The following section will explore the strengths and limitations of GenAI in more detail, providing a comprehensive overview of the opportunities and challenges associated with this transformative technology.



#### <a id="133-understanding-the-strengths-and-limitations-of-genai"></a>1.3.3 Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of GenAI

Having explored the core models underpinning Generative AI (GenAI), it is now crucial to critically assess both its strengths and limitations. For the UN Statistics Division (UNSD), a balanced understanding is paramount to strategically deploying GenAI, maximising its benefits while mitigating potential risks. This section provides a comprehensive overview of these strengths and limitations, informing a responsible and effective GenAI strategy.

GenAI offers several compelling strengths that can significantly enhance the UNSD's operations. As previously discussed, its ability to automate tasks, generate insights, and improve data quality holds immense potential. Specifically, GenAI can:

- **Accelerate statistical production:** Automating report generation, text summarisation, and data augmentation can drastically reduce the time and resources required for statistical production.
- **Enhance data quality and completeness:** GenAI can improve data imputation, anomaly detection, and data harmonisation, leading to more accurate and reliable official statistics.
- **Improve data accessibility and usability:** GenAI can create user-friendly data visualisations, interactive dashboards, and chatbots, making data more accessible to a wider audience.

- **Speed up implementation of standards:** AI tools like the ARIES for SEEA Explorer can significantly speed up the adoption and implementation of new international standards, such as the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) Ecosystem Accounting.

These strengths align directly with the pain points identified earlier, offering practical solutions to the challenges facing traditional statistical production. However, it is equally important to acknowledge the limitations of GenAI to avoid unrealistic expectations and ensure responsible implementation.

One of the most significant limitations is the potential for **bias**. GenAI models are trained on data, and if that data reflects existing societal biases, the models will perpetuate and amplify those biases. This can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes, particularly in areas such as social and economic statistics. As a leading expert in AI bias warns, AI systems are mirrors reflecting the biases of their creators and the data they are trained on.

Another key concern is the **lack of transparency and explainability**. Many GenAI models are black boxes, making it difficult to understand how they arrive at their conclusions. This lack of transparency can undermine trust in official statistics, particularly if users are unable to verify the accuracy and reliability of the data. The external knowledge highlights challenges related to the reliability, traceability, and transparency of GenAI outputs.

Furthermore, GenAI models can be prone to **inaccuracies and hallucinations**. They may generate information that appears factual but is, in fact, incorrect or nonsensical. This is particularly problematic in areas where accuracy is paramount, such as economic forecasting and demographic analysis. The external knowledge specifically mentions the risk of "AI hallucinations," emphasising the need to verify the accuracy of AI-generated content.

The **reliance on large amounts of data** is another limitation. GenAI models require vast datasets to train effectively, which may not always be available, particularly in developing countries or for niche statistical domains. This can limit the applicability of GenAI in certain contexts. Datasets and models are also heavily skewed towards English, creating a disparity in resources for other languages.

Additionally, **security and privacy concerns** are paramount. The use of GenAI may involve processing sensitive or confidential data, raising concerns about data breaches and privacy violations. It is essential to implement robust security measures to protect data and comply with relevant privacy regulations. The external knowledge highlights the security of data and privacy as a significant concern, especially with sensitive or confidential information.

- Data Bias: AI models can perpetuate and amplify biases present in the data they are trained on, including gender biases. It is crucial to mitigate these biases in both data and algorithms.
- Inaccuracies and Hallucinations: GenAI can generate information that appears factual but is often inaccurate. This is referred to as "AI hallucinations," so it is essential to verify the accuracy of AI-generated content.
- Lack of Understanding: GenAI models do not truly "understand" the content they use and generate.
- Limited Representation: GenAI may struggle to represent underrepresented or niche knowledge due to its reliance on data from centralized platforms, potentially reflecting the biases of these sources.
- Security Concerns: The security of data and privacy is a significant concern when using AI tools, especially with sensitive or confidential information.
- Intellectual Property Issues: The use of AI tools can raise intellectual property issues, particularly when they are trained on open-source data.
- Transparency and Traceability: Challenges exist related to the reliability, traceability, and transparency of GenAI outputs.
- Rapid Technological Changes: The legal and governance frameworks need to adapt to the quick changes in a polarized and uncertain environment.
- English Language Dominance: Datasets and models are heavily skewed towards English, creating a disparity in resources for other languages.

To effectively address these limitations, the UNSD must adopt a responsible and ethical approach to GenAI implementation. This includes:

- Developing strategies for bias detection and mitigation.
- Implementing transparency mechanisms for GenAI processes.
- Protecting data privacy and confidentiality.
- Establishing data quality standards for GenAI applications.
- Defining data access and sharing protocols.
- Ensuring data security and compliance.
- Monitoring and evaluating the performance of GenAI applications.
- Promoting collaboration and knowledge sharing in the GenAI community.

By carefully considering both the strengths and limitations of GenAI, the UNSD can develop a strategic roadmap for its implementation, maximising its benefits while mitigating potential risks. The following chapters will delve deeper into these considerations, providing practical guidance on ethical implementation, use case development, infrastructure building, and impact measurement.

#### <a id="211-bias-and-fairness-in-genai-models"></a>2.1.1 Bias and Fairness in GenAI Models

As GenAI models become increasingly integrated into the UN Statistics Division's (UNSD) processes, addressing bias and ensuring fairness are paramount. The potential for these models to perpetuate and amplify existing societal inequalities poses a significant ethical challenge that must be proactively managed. This section delves into the nature of bias in GenAI, its sources, impact, and mitigation strategies, aligning with the UN's commitment to equality and non-discrimination. It builds upon the previous discussion of the strengths and limitations of GenAI, highlighting that while GenAI offers immense potential, its responsible implementation hinges on addressing these ethical considerations.

Bias in GenAI models manifests as systematic and unfair discrimination against certain groups or individuals. This can lead to unequal outcomes and reinforce harmful stereotypes, undermining the credibility and trustworthiness of official statistics. The impact of biased AI systems extends beyond mere statistical inaccuracies; it can affect public perception, influence policy decisions, and perpetuate societal inequalities, particularly in sensitive areas such as healthcare, employment, and criminal justice. Therefore, understanding the sources and types of bias is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies.

Several factors contribute to bias in GenAI models. Data bias, arising from skewed or unrepresentative training data, is a primary source. If certain ethnicities, cultures, or socioeconomic groups are underrepresented or misrepresented in the training data, GenAI models may produce inaccurate or culturally insensitive representations. Algorithm design can also introduce bias if fairness isn't a key design consideration. Human cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias and anchoring bias, can further exacerbate the problem, leading AI team members to prioritise information that confirms their pre-existing beliefs or assumptions. Feedback loops, where GenAI relies on user feedback to improve its outputs, can reinforce existing biases if the feedback is itself biased. As a leading expert in AI fairness observed, The challenge is not just about identifying bias, but about understanding its root causes and developing strategies to prevent it from creeping into our models.

- Data Bias: Bias in training data significantly influences the potential for biased results. It is essential to ensure that training data sets are diverse, inclusive, and representative of the full spectrum of human experiences and perspectives.
- Algorithm Design: Algorithms can introduce bias if fairness isn't a key design consideration.
- Human Cognitive Biases: Confirmation bias can lead AI team members to prioritise information that confirms their pre-existing beliefs or assumptions. Anchoring bias can result in flawed decision-making and the propagation of inaccurate or biased assumptions based on incomplete or inaccurate initial information.
- Feedback Loops: Generative AI relies on user feedback to judge, confirm, and improve its outputs, which can reinforce existing biases.

Mitigating bias requires a multi-faceted approach, encompassing diverse datasets, fairness constraints, regular bias testing, transparency, continuous monitoring, and post-processing techniques. Diverse datasets are essential for ensuring that GenAI models are trained on representative samples of the population. Fairness constraints can be implemented within models to actively counteract known biases. Regular bias testing, simulating diverse user interactions, can detect and quantify biases in model outputs. Transparency and interpretability are crucial for building trust in AI systems. Continuous monitoring and evaluation are necessary to ensure that models remain fair and relevant over time. Post-processing techniques can adjust the output of AI models to remove bias and ensure fairness. The external knowledge emphasizes the importance of data cleansing to remove PII, toxicity, and bias, as well as input and output safeguards to ensure compliance with content policies.

- Diverse Datasets: Use diverse and representative datasets during training.
- Fairness Constraints: Implement fairness constraints within models to actively counteract known biases.
- Regular Bias Testing: Develop testing protocols that simulate diverse user interactions to detect and quantify biases in model outputs. Use tooling like bias detection frameworks to analyze the results and measure effectiveness.
- Transparency and Interpretability: Improve transparency to build trust in AI systems.
- Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation: Continuously monitor and update models to ensure fair and relevant results.
- Post-processing: Adjust the output of AI models to remove bias and ensure fairness.

Fairness can be defined in various ways, including group fairness and individual fairness. Group fairness aims to ensure that AI systems do not discriminate against any particular group, while individual fairness prevents AI systems from making decisions that are systematically biased against certain individuals. The choice of fairness metric depends on the specific application and the context in which the AI system is being used. As a senior government official stated, Fairness is not a one-size-fits-all concept. We need to carefully consider the specific context and the potential impact on different groups when defining fairness metrics.

Consider the use of GenAI to generate synthetic data for training machine learning models. If the synthetic data is biased, the resulting machine learning models will also be biased. To mitigate this risk, the UNSD should ensure that the synthetic data is generated using diverse and representative datasets, and that fairness constraints are implemented within the GenAI model. Regular bias testing should also be conducted to identify and correct any biases in the synthetic data. This proactive approach to bias mitigation is essential for ensuring that GenAI is used responsibly and ethically in official statistics.

In conclusion, addressing bias and ensuring fairness are critical for the responsible implementation of GenAI in official statistics. By understanding the sources and types of bias, implementing effective mitigation strategies, and continuously monitoring and evaluating the performance of GenAI models, the UNSD can unlock the full potential of GenAI while upholding its commitment to equality and non-discrimination. The following sections will explore other ethical considerations, such as transparency and data privacy, providing a comprehensive framework for responsible AI use.



#### <a id="212-transparency-and-explainability-in-statistical-applications"></a>2.1.2 Transparency and Explainability in Statistical Applications

Building on the discussion of bias and fairness, transparency and explainability are equally crucial for ethical GenAI implementation within the UNSD. Transparency refers to the degree to which the inner workings of a GenAI model are understandable and accessible, while explainability focuses on making the outputs of a model understandable to humans. These concepts are vital for building trust in GenAI-generated statistics and ensuring accountability in decision-making. Without transparency and explainability, it becomes difficult to assess the reliability of GenAI outputs and to identify potential errors or biases.

Transparency and explainability are particularly important in the context of official statistics, where data is used to inform policy decisions and to hold governments accountable. If the public cannot understand how statistical estimates are produced, they may lose trust in the entire statistical system. This can have serious consequences for democratic governance and public policy. Therefore, the UNSD must prioritise transparency and explainability in all its GenAI initiatives.

Achieving transparency and explainability in GenAI models can be challenging, as many of these models are complex and opaque. However, several techniques can be used to improve transparency and explainability. These include:

- Documenting the data used to train the model, including its sources, characteristics, and potential biases.
- Providing a clear explanation of the model's architecture and how it works.
- Using explainable AI (XAI) techniques to understand the model's decision-making processes.
- Visualising the model's outputs in a way that is easy to understand.
- Providing users with access to the model's code and data, allowing them to verify its accuracy and reliability.

Explainable AI (XAI) techniques are particularly useful for understanding the decision-making processes of GenAI models. These techniques aim to provide insights into why a model produced a specific result, allowing users to understand the factors that influenced the model's output. XAI techniques include feature importance analysis, which identifies the features that are most important for the model's predictions, and counterfactual explanations, which explain how the model's output would change if certain inputs were modified. These techniques can help to build trust in GenAI models and to identify potential biases or errors.

The external knowledge emphasizes the importance of transparency and explainability for building trust in AI systems. Transparency helps to promote trust in the system, while explainability is concerned with establishing trust in specific outputs. Both are crucial for the ethical application of GenAI in statistical applications and official statistics.

Consider the use of GenAI to generate synthetic data for training machine learning models. If the synthetic data is used to train a model that predicts unemployment rates, it is important to understand how the GenAI model generated the synthetic data and what factors influenced its output. This would allow users to assess the reliability of the synthetic data and to identify any potential biases or errors. Without this transparency, it would be difficult to trust the results of the machine learning model.

> Transparency is not just about providing information, it's about providing the *right* information in a way that is understandable and accessible, says a senior government official.

Implementing transparency mechanisms requires a commitment from all stakeholders, including data scientists, statisticians, and policymakers. Data scientists must be trained in XAI techniques and must be encouraged to document their models and data thoroughly. Statisticians must be involved in the development and evaluation of GenAI models, ensuring that they meet the required standards of accuracy and reliability. Policymakers must create a regulatory framework that promotes transparency and accountability in the use of AI. The UN Principles for Ethical AI, discussed in the following section, provide a valuable framework for guiding these efforts.

In conclusion, transparency and explainability are essential for the responsible implementation of GenAI in official statistics. By adopting transparency mechanisms and XAI techniques, the UNSD can build trust in GenAI-generated statistics and ensure accountability in decision-making. The following section will explore data privacy and security considerations, providing a comprehensive framework for ethical AI use.



#### <a id="213-data-privacy-and-security-considerations"></a>2.1.3 Data Privacy and Security Considerations

Building upon the discussions of bias, fairness, transparency, and explainability, data privacy and security are paramount ethical considerations for GenAI implementation within the UN Statistics Division (UNSD). These considerations are not merely technical challenges but fundamental rights that must be protected. The use of GenAI, particularly with sensitive statistical data, necessitates robust safeguards to prevent unauthorised access, disclosure, or misuse of information. Failure to address these concerns can erode public trust, compromise data integrity, and violate international privacy laws.

Data privacy focuses on the rights of individuals to control the collection, use, and disclosure of their personal information. In the context of official statistics, this includes protecting the confidentiality of individual responses to surveys and censuses. GenAI models, which often require large amounts of data for training, can pose a threat to data privacy if not properly managed. For example, if a GenAI model is trained on data that contains personally identifiable information (PII), it may be possible to infer sensitive information about individuals, even if the PII has been removed. The external knowledge emphasizes the importance of data cleansing to remove PII, toxicity, and bias.

Data security, on the other hand, focuses on protecting data from unauthorised access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. This includes implementing technical and organisational measures to prevent data breaches, cyberattacks, and other security incidents. GenAI systems, which often involve complex software and hardware infrastructure, can be vulnerable to security threats if not properly secured. For example, a malicious actor could exploit vulnerabilities in a GenAI model to gain access to sensitive data or to manipulate the model's outputs. The external knowledge highlights the security of data and privacy as a significant concern when using AI tools, especially with sensitive or confidential information.

Several strategies can be employed to address data privacy and security concerns in GenAI applications. These include:

- Data anonymisation and pseudonymisation: Removing or masking PII to prevent identification of individuals.
- Differential privacy: Adding noise to data to protect individual privacy while still allowing for statistical analysis.
- Secure multi-party computation: Allowing multiple parties to perform computations on data without revealing their individual inputs.
- Access controls and encryption: Limiting access to data and encrypting data to protect it from unauthorised access.
- Regular security audits and penetration testing: Identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in GenAI systems.
- Data governance policies: Establishing clear policies and procedures for data collection, use, and disclosure.
- Privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs): Employing techniques that minimise data processing and maximise data protection.

The external knowledge also emphasizes the importance of input and output safeguards to ensure compliance with content policies. These safeguards can help to prevent the generation of biased, discriminatory, or harmful content. Furthermore, the external knowledge highlights the need for legal and governance frameworks to adapt to the quick changes in a polarised and uncertain environment.

Consider the use of GenAI to generate synthetic data for training machine learning models. If the synthetic data is used to train a model that predicts poverty rates, it is crucial to ensure that the synthetic data does not reveal any sensitive information about individuals or households. This can be achieved by using data anonymisation techniques and differential privacy to protect individual privacy. Furthermore, access controls and encryption should be implemented to protect the synthetic data from unauthorised access.

> Data privacy and security are not just technical issues, they are fundamental human rights that must be protected, says a leading expert in data governance.

Implementing robust data privacy and security measures requires a collaborative effort from all stakeholders, including data scientists, statisticians, policymakers, and legal experts. Data scientists must be trained in privacy-enhancing technologies and must be encouraged to design GenAI systems that prioritise data privacy and security. Statisticians must be involved in the development and evaluation of GenAI systems, ensuring that they meet the required standards of accuracy and reliability. Policymakers must create a regulatory framework that promotes data privacy and security in the use of AI. The UN Principles for Ethical AI, discussed in the following section, provide a valuable framework for guiding these efforts.

In conclusion, data privacy and security are essential for the responsible implementation of GenAI in official statistics. By adopting robust data privacy and security measures, the UNSD can protect individual rights, maintain public trust, and ensure the integrity of official statistics. The following sections will explore the UN Principles for Ethical AI, providing a comprehensive framework for ethical AI use.



### <a id="22-un-principles-for-ethical-ai-a-framework-for-unsd"></a>2.2 UN Principles for Ethical AI: A Framework for UNSD

#### <a id="221-aligning-genai-initiatives-with-un-ethical-guidelines"></a>2.2.1 Aligning GenAI Initiatives with UN Ethical Guidelines

The UN System Chief Executives Board for Coordination endorsed a set of principles in September 2022, designed to guide the ethical use of AI across the UN system. These principles are grounded in ethics and human rights, providing a crucial framework for the UNSD as it integrates GenAI into its operations. Aligning GenAI initiatives with these guidelines is not merely a matter of compliance but a fundamental commitment to responsible innovation and the upholding of UN values. This alignment ensures that GenAI serves the global community equitably and ethically, building upon the earlier discussions of bias, transparency, and data privacy.

The UN's ethical guidelines for AI emphasise several key considerations that are directly relevant to the UNSD's GenAI strategy. These include 'do no harm,' safety and security, fairness, sustainability, privacy, human autonomy, transparency, and accountability. Each of these principles must be carefully considered when designing, developing, and deploying GenAI applications within the UNSD. Failure to do so could undermine the credibility of official statistics and erode public trust.

- **Do No Harm:** Ensuring that GenAI applications do not cause harm to individuals or groups, either directly or indirectly. This requires careful consideration of potential biases and unintended consequences.
- **Safety and Security:** Protecting GenAI systems from cyberattacks and other security threats, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of data.
- **Fairness:** Promoting equitable outcomes and avoiding discrimination against any particular group or individual. This requires careful attention to data bias and algorithm design.
- **Sustainability:** Ensuring that GenAI initiatives are environmentally sustainable and contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
- **Privacy:** Protecting the privacy of individuals by implementing robust data anonymisation and security measures.
- **Human Autonomy:** Respecting human autonomy and ensuring that GenAI systems are used to augment, rather than replace, human decision-making.
- **Transparency:** Making the inner workings of GenAI models understandable and accessible, allowing users to verify their accuracy and reliability.
- **Accountability:** Establishing clear lines of accountability for the development and deployment of GenAI systems, ensuring that those responsible are held accountable for their actions.

To effectively align GenAI initiatives with these principles, the UNSD should establish a clear governance framework for responsible AI use. This framework should include policies and procedures for data collection, model development, deployment, and monitoring. It should also include mechanisms for addressing ethical concerns and resolving disputes. The framework should be developed in consultation with a wide range of stakeholders, including data scientists, statisticians, policymakers, and civil society representatives.

Consider the use of GenAI to generate synthetic data for training machine learning models. To align this initiative with the UN's ethical guidelines, the UNSD should ensure that the synthetic data is generated using diverse and representative datasets, that fairness constraints are implemented within the GenAI model, and that data privacy is protected through anonymisation and security measures. Furthermore, the UNSD should be transparent about the methods used to generate the synthetic data and should establish clear lines of accountability for its use.

> Ethical AI is not just about avoiding harm, it's about creating a future where AI benefits all of humanity, says a leading expert in AI ethics.

The UNFPA is using GenAI in evaluation practices, adhering to ethical and responsible use clauses. The UNU is developing internal policies on GenAI use, balancing innovation with responsibility. These examples demonstrate the UN system's commitment to ethical AI implementation, providing valuable lessons for the UNSD.

In conclusion, aligning GenAI initiatives with the UN's ethical guidelines is essential for ensuring that these technologies are used responsibly and ethically. By adopting a clear governance framework, implementing robust safeguards, and engaging with stakeholders, the UNSD can unlock the full potential of GenAI while upholding its commitment to UN values. The following sections will explore the establishment of a governance framework and ensuring accountability and oversight, providing a comprehensive roadmap for responsible AI use.



#### <a id="222-establishing-a-governance-framework-for-responsible-ai-use"></a>2.2.2 Establishing a Governance Framework for Responsible AI Use

The external knowledge provides several key areas of focus for oversight, including the reasons for using GenAI, algorithmic accountability, data training, bias monitoring, third- and fourth-party risk management, benefits and risks, governance framework, risk management, workforce impact, financial planning, and compliance. Structuring board oversight, ensuring human oversight, and addressing risks and challenges are also crucial aspects of ensuring accountability and oversight.

Consider the use of GenAI for data imputation. To ensure accountability and oversight, the UNSD should conduct regular audits of the GenAI model to assess its accuracy and reliability. An ethics review board should evaluate the ethical implications of using GenAI for data imputation, considering potential biases and unintended consequences. Whistleblower protection policies should be in place to encourage staff to report any concerns about the use of GenAI for data imputation. An impact assessment should be conducted to evaluate the potential impact of using GenAI for data imputation on the accuracy and reliability of official statistics.

> Accountability is not just about assigning blame, it's about creating a culture of responsibility and continuous improvement, says a senior government official.

In addition to these mechanisms, the UNSD should also establish a clear process for addressing complaints and resolving disputes related to GenAI initiatives. This process should be transparent, accessible, and fair, ensuring that all stakeholders have an opportunity to voice their concerns and have them addressed in a timely manner. The OECD principles, including inclusive growth, human rights, transparency, robustness, and accountability, should guide the development and implementation of this process.

In conclusion, ensuring accountability and oversight is essential for responsible AI use within the UNSD. By implementing robust mechanisms for monitoring, evaluating, and addressing ethical concerns, the UNSD can build trust in GenAI-generated statistics and ensure that these technologies are used in a way that benefits society. This completes the framework for ethical and responsible GenAI implementation, setting the stage for exploring practical applications and infrastructure requirements in subsequent chapters.

This can involve feature importance analysis, counterfactual explanations, and other methods for understanding model behaviour.
- **Data Visualisation:** Using data visualisation tools to identify patterns, outliers, and noise in data that could lead to bias.

The external knowledge emphasises the importance of fairness metrics, bias detection tools, data audits, ethical reviews, red-teaming, and data visualisation for bias detection. These strategies should be integrated into the UNSD's GenAI development lifecycle, ensuring that bias is detected and addressed at every stage.

Bias mitigation involves implementing strategies to reduce or eliminate bias in GenAI models and their outputs. This requires a combination of technical interventions, data adjustments, and human oversight. Several techniques can be used for bias mitigation, including:

- **Diverse and Representative Data:** Using high-quality data from multiple trusted sources, collecting data from different demographics, cultures, and backgrounds, analysing data to pinpoint and correct imbalances, removing or anonymising sensitive information, and employing techniques like data augmentation to introduce variations.
- **Fairness-Aware Training:** Training models with fairness in mind, using adversarial training, applying fairness constraints in optimisation processes, and re-weighting data to balance representation of underrepresented groups.
- **Algorithmic Techniques:** Implementing algorithmic fairness techniques and using prompt engineering to guide models to generate desired outputs.
- **Human Oversight and Governance:** Implementing human review of AI-assisted decisions and establishing a committee to govern the ethical and responsible use of GenAI, prioritising inclusive leadership and psychological safety.
- **Continuous Monitoring and Improvement:** Continuously monitoring model performance and fine-tuning as needed, gathering and acting on user feedback, and regularly updating datasets to reflect societal changes.
- **Transparency and Documentation:** Documenting data curation and labelling processes and clearly explaining the decision-making process behind AI algorithms.

The external knowledge highlights the importance of diverse data, fairness-aware training, human oversight, continuous monitoring, transparency, and algorithmic techniques for bias mitigation. These strategies should be tailored to the specific context of each GenAI application, considering the potential impact on different groups and the ethical implications of different mitigation techniques.

Consider the use of GenAI to generate synthetic data for training machine learning models. To mitigate bias in this application, the UNSD should ensure that the synthetic data is generated using diverse and representative datasets, that fairness constraints are implemented within the GenAI model, and that human oversight is provided to review and validate the synthetic data. Regular bias audits should be conducted to identify and correct any biases in the synthetic data.

> Mitigating bias is an ongoing process, not a one-time fix. It requires continuous monitoring, evaluation, and adaptation, says a leading expert in AI fairness.

In addition to these technical and data-driven strategies, it is also important to foster a culture of awareness and sensitivity to bias within the UNSD. This involves providing training to staff on the ethical implications of AI, encouraging open discussions about bias, and promoting diverse perspectives in the development and deployment of GenAI applications. By creating a culture of ethical awareness, the UNSD can ensure that bias is actively addressed and mitigated at all levels of the organisation.

In conclusion, developing effective strategies for bias detection and mitigation is essential for promoting trust in GenAI-generated statistics. By implementing a combination of technical tools, data adjustments, human oversight, and cultural awareness, the UNSD can minimise the risk of bias and ensure that GenAI is used responsibly and ethically. The following sections will explore other mechanisms for promoting trust in GenAI processes, including transparency and data privacy.



#### <a id="232-implementing-transparency-mechanisms-for-genai-processes"></a>2.3.2 Implementing Transparency Mechanisms for GenAI Processes

Building upon the strategies for bias detection and mitigation, implementing robust transparency mechanisms is crucial for fostering trust in GenAI-generated statistics. Transparency, as previously discussed, involves making the inner workings of GenAI models understandable and accessible, allowing users to assess their reliability and identify potential limitations. This section outlines practical mechanisms for enhancing transparency in GenAI processes, ensuring that the UNSD's use of these technologies is open, accountable, and trustworthy.

Transparency mechanisms should be implemented throughout the GenAI lifecycle, from data collection and model development to deployment and monitoring.

The external knowledge underscores the multifaceted nature of transparency in GenAI processes, highlighting its importance for building trust, ensuring accountability, mitigating biases, and enabling informed decision-making. By implementing these mechanisms, the UNSD can foster greater transparency in its GenAI initiatives, leading to more trustworthy, reliable, and ethical AI systems.

Consider the use of GenAI for automated report generation. To enhance transparency in this application, the UNSD should provide users with access to the model's code and data, allowing them to verify its accuracy and reliability. The UNSD should also document the data used to train the model, including its sources, characteristics, and potential biases. Furthermore, the UNSD should use XAI techniques to explain how the model generates the reports, allowing users to understand the factors that influence the model's output.

> Transparency is not just about providing information, it's about providing the *right* information in a way that is understandable and accessible, says a leading expert in the field.

Implementing these transparency mechanisms requires a commitment from all stakeholders, including data scientists, statisticians, policymakers, and the public. Data scientists must be trained in XAI techniques and must be encouraged to document their models and data thoroughly. Statisticians must be involved in the development and evaluation of GenAI models, ensuring that they meet the required standards of accuracy and reliability. Policymakers must create a regulatory framework that promotes transparency and accountability in the use of AI. The UN Principles for Ethical AI, previously discussed, provide a valuable framework for guiding these efforts.

In conclusion, implementing robust transparency mechanisms is essential for promoting trust in GenAI-generated statistics. By providing users with clear and comprehensive information about the data, algorithms, and processes used to generate statistical outputs, the UNSD can ensure that its use of GenAI is open, accountable, and trustworthy. The following section will explore strategies for protecting data privacy and confidentiality, providing a comprehensive framework for ethical AI use.



#### <a id="233-protecting-data-privacy-and-confidentiality"></a>2.3.3 Protecting Data Privacy and Confidentiality

Building upon the strategies for bias detection, mitigation, and transparency, protecting data privacy and confidentiality is paramount for maintaining trust in GenAI-generated statistics. As previously discussed, the use of sensitive statistical data necessitates robust safeguards to prevent unauthorised access, disclosure, or misuse of information. This section outlines practical strategies for protecting data privacy and confidentiality in GenAI processes, ensuring that the UNSD's use of these technologies complies with ethical principles and legal requirements.

Data privacy and confidentiality are not merely technical concerns but fundamental rights that must be actively protected. The UNSD handles vast amounts of sensitive data, including individual responses to surveys and censuses, economic data, and demographic information. The use of GenAI, particularly with large language models (LLMs), can increase the risk of data breaches and privacy violations if appropriate safeguards are not in place. Therefore, it is essential to implement a comprehensive set of measures to protect data privacy and confidentiality throughout the GenAI lifecycle.

Several key strategies can be employed to protect data privacy and confidentiality in GenAI applications. These strategies should be implemented in a layered approach, combining technical controls, organisational policies, and legal frameworks.

- **Data Anonymisation and Pseudonymisation:** Removing or masking personally identifiable information (PII) to prevent the identification of individuals. This can involve techniques such as data suppression, generalisation, and perturbation.
- **Differential Privacy:** Adding noise to data to protect individual privacy while still allowing for statistical analysis. This ensures that the presence or absence of any individual's data does not significantly affect the results of the analysis.
- **Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC):** Allowing multiple parties to perform computations on data without revealing their individual inputs. This is particularly useful for collaborative statistical analysis where data cannot be shared directly.
- **Federated Learning:** Training GenAI models on decentralised data sources without transferring the data to a central location. This protects data privacy by keeping the data on the individual devices or servers.
- **Access Controls and Encryption:** Limiting access to data and encrypting data to protect it from unauthorised access. This includes implementing strong authentication mechanisms and regularly reviewing access privileges.
- **Data Minimisation:** Collecting only the data that is necessary for the specific purpose and retaining it only for as long as it is needed. This reduces the risk of data breaches and privacy violations.
- **Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs):** Employing techniques that minimise data processing and maximise data protection. This includes homomorphic encryption, zero-knowledge proofs, and other advanced cryptographic techniques.
- **Data Governance Policies:** Establishing clear policies and procedures for data collection, use, disclosure, and retention. These policies should be based on international privacy standards and best practices.
- **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in GenAI systems. This includes conducting regular security audits and penetration testing to ensure that the systems are secure from cyberattacks.
- **Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs):** Assessing the risks associated with using GenAI tools and implementing appropriate safeguards, as highlighted in the external knowledge.

The external knowledge emphasises the importance of data cleansing to remove PII, toxicity, and bias, as well as input and output safeguards to ensure compliance with content policies. These measures are essential for protecting data privacy and confidentiality in GenAI applications.

Consider the use of GenAI for data imputation. To protect data privacy and confidentiality in this application, the UNSD should ensure that the data is anonymised before being used to train the GenAI model. Differential privacy techniques should be used to add noise to the data, protecting individual privacy while still allowing for accurate data imputation. Access controls and encryption should be implemented to protect the data from unauthorised access.

> Data privacy is not an obstacle to innovation, it is a prerequisite for trust, says a leading expert in data privacy.

Implementing these data privacy and confidentiality measures requires a collaborative effort from all stakeholders, including data scientists, statisticians, policymakers, and legal experts. Data scientists must be trained in privacy-enhancing technologies and must be encouraged to design GenAI systems that prioritise data privacy and security. Statisticians must be involved in the development and evaluation of GenAI systems, ensuring that they meet the required standards of accuracy and reliability. Policymakers must create a regulatory framework that promotes data privacy and security in the use of AI. The UN Principles for Ethical AI, previously discussed, provide a valuable framework for guiding these efforts.

In conclusion, protecting data privacy and confidentiality is essential for responsible AI use within the UNSD. By implementing robust data privacy and security measures, the UNSD can maintain public trust, comply with legal requirements, and ensure the integrity of official statistics. This completes the framework for ethical and responsible GenAI implementation, setting the stage for exploring practical applications and infrastructure requirements in subsequent chapters. The next chapter will focus on GenAI applications for statistical data enhancement, exploring specific use cases and implementation strategies.

#### <a id="311-data-imputation-filling-in-missing-values-with-genai"></a>3.1.1 Data Imputation: Filling in Missing Values with GenAI

Data imputation, the process of filling in missing values in datasets, is a critical step in enhancing data quality and completeness. As highlighted in earlier chapters, missing data can significantly compromise the accuracy and reliability of official statistics, leading to biased analyses and flawed policy decisions. Traditional imputation methods, such as mean imputation or regression imputation, often fall short in capturing the complex relationships within data, potentially introducing further errors. Generative AI (GenAI) offers a powerful alternative, leveraging its ability to learn intricate patterns and generate realistic data to fill in missing values with greater accuracy and efficiency.

GenAI models can learn the underlying data distribution and relationships between variables by training on complete datasets. This allows them to infer missing values with a high degree of accuracy, even when data is not missing completely at random. Unlike traditional methods, GenAI can capture non-linear relationships and complex dependencies, leading to more realistic and reliable imputations. This is particularly valuable in official statistics, where datasets often contain intricate patterns and interdependencies.

Several GenAI models are particularly well-suited for data imputation. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), a type of neural network, can model the data distribution and generate plausible data points to fill in the gaps. They are especially useful when data is not missing completely at random, as they can capture the latent structure of the data and generate realistic imputations. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, working together to produce realistic data samples. The generator creates synthetic data points, while the discriminator evaluates their authenticity. This process continues until the generator produces data indistinguishable from the real dataset. GANs are effective because they can capture intricate data distributions and dependencies. The external knowledge confirms the suitability of VAEs and GANs for data imputation.

- **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** Model the data distribution and generate plausible data points to fill in the gaps.
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** Consist of a generator and a discriminator, working together to produce realistic data samples.

The application of GenAI for data imputation extends across various domains within official statistics. In healthcare, where patient records often contain missing values due to privacy concerns or incomplete data collection, GAN-based models can be trained on complete datasets of patient records to learn the complex interactions between various health indicators and impute missing values. In time series data, where gaps may arise from sensor malfunctions or data collection inconsistencies, generative AI can be combined with image processing methods to fill in missing values. The time series data is converted into images, and cGANs (conditional Generative Adversarial Networks) are trained to fill in missing pixels in images created from incomplete time series data. These examples demonstrate the versatility of GenAI in addressing data imputation challenges across different statistical domains.

However, it is crucial to acknowledge the challenges and considerations associated with GenAI-based data imputation. Determining appropriate parameters, addressing missing data mechanisms, and assessing imputation accuracy are all critical steps in the implementation process. As highlighted in earlier chapters, bias in training data can significantly impact the accuracy and fairness of GenAI models. Therefore, it is essential to carefully evaluate the training data for biases and implement mitigation strategies to ensure that the imputed values are not skewed or discriminatory. Furthermore, transparency and explainability are crucial for building trust in GenAI-generated imputations. Users should be able to understand how the GenAI model arrived at its imputations and to assess the reliability of the imputed values.

To ensure responsible and ethical implementation of GenAI for data imputation, the UNSD should adhere to the ethical guidelines and governance framework outlined in Chapter 2. This includes establishing clear data governance policies, implementing robust security measures, and ensuring transparency and accountability in the imputation process. Furthermore, the UNSD should engage with stakeholders, including data scientists, statisticians, and policymakers, to ensure that the GenAI-based data imputation methods are aligned with their needs and concerns.

In conclusion, GenAI offers a significant advancement in handling missing data within data engineering. By using advanced generative models like VAEs and GANs, data engineers can overcome the limitations of traditional imputation methods, significantly improving data quality. However, responsible and ethical implementation is crucial, requiring careful consideration of data bias, transparency, and accountability. By adhering to the ethical guidelines and governance framework outlined in Chapter 2, the UNSD can unlock the full potential of GenAI for data imputation while upholding its commitment to responsible innovation and the integrity of official statistics.



#### <a id="312-anomaly-detection-identifying-outliers-and-errors-in-datasets"></a>3.1.2 Anomaly Detection: Identifying Outliers and Errors in Datasets

Anomaly detection, the process of identifying data points that deviate significantly from the norm, is crucial for enhancing data quality and completeness. As discussed in earlier chapters, outliers and errors can distort statistical analyses and lead to inaccurate conclusions. Traditional anomaly detection methods, such as statistical rules or simple machine learning algorithms, often struggle to identify subtle or complex anomalies, particularly in high-dimensional datasets. Generative AI (GenAI) offers a powerful alternative, leveraging its ability to learn the underlying data distribution and identify deviations from that distribution with greater accuracy and sophistication.

GenAI models can learn the normal patterns and relationships within data by training on datasets that primarily contain normal data points. Once trained, these models can then identify data points that deviate significantly from the learned patterns, flagging them as anomalies. This approach is particularly effective for identifying anomalies that are difficult to detect using traditional methods, such as contextual anomalies or collective anomalies. Furthermore, GenAI can automate the anomaly detection process, reducing the need for manual inspection and improving efficiency.

Several GenAI models are particularly well-suited for anomaly detection. Autoencoders, a type of neural network, can learn a compressed representation of the data and then reconstruct the original data from this representation. Anomalies are identified as data points that are poorly reconstructed, indicating that they deviate significantly from the learned patterns. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can also be used for anomaly detection. The generator creates synthetic data points, while the discriminator evaluates their authenticity. Anomalies are identified as data points that are easily distinguished from the synthetic data, indicating that they deviate significantly from the learned data distribution. The external knowledge confirms the suitability of autoencoders and GANs for anomaly detection.

- Autoencoders: Learn a compressed representation of the data and identify anomalies as data points that are poorly reconstructed.
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Identify anomalies as data points that are easily distinguished from synthetic data.

The application of GenAI for anomaly detection spans various domains within official statistics. In fraud detection, GenAI models can be trained on historical transaction data to identify fraudulent transactions that deviate from normal spending patterns. In manufacturing, GenAI models can be trained on sensor data from equipment to detect anomalies that indicate potential equipment failures. In cybersecurity, GenAI models can be trained on network traffic data to identify anomalous network activity that may indicate a cyberattack. These examples demonstrate the versatility of GenAI in addressing anomaly detection challenges across different statistical domains.

However, it is crucial to acknowledge the challenges and considerations associated with GenAI-based anomaly detection. The choice of the appropriate GenAI model, the selection of training data, and the setting of anomaly thresholds are all critical steps in the implementation process. As highlighted in earlier chapters, bias in training data can significantly impact the accuracy and fairness of GenAI models. Therefore, it is essential to carefully evaluate the training data for biases and implement mitigation strategies to ensure that the anomaly detection process is not skewed or discriminatory. Furthermore, transparency and explainability are crucial for building trust in GenAI-generated anomaly detections. Users should be able to understand why a data point was flagged as an anomaly and to assess the reliability of the anomaly detection process.

The external knowledge provides a breakdown of anomaly detection, outliers, errors, and datasets. Anomaly detection is the process of identifying data points that deviate from the norm. Outliers are data points that differ significantly from other observations in a dataset. Errors can include typing errors, NULL values, and inconsistencies. Datasets are available for anomaly detection research and development.

To ensure responsible and ethical implementation of GenAI for anomaly detection, the UNSD should adhere to the ethical guidelines and governance framework outlined in Chapter 2. This includes establishing clear data governance policies, implementing robust security measures, and ensuring transparency and accountability in the anomaly detection process. Furthermore, the UNSD should engage with stakeholders, including data scientists, statisticians, and policymakers, to ensure that the GenAI-based anomaly detection methods are aligned with their needs and concerns.

In the context of error detection, anomaly detection techniques can be used to identify errors in datasets. By establishing a normal profile of the data, anomalies that represent errors can be flagged.

In addition to these mechanisms, the UNSD should also foster a culture of ethical awareness among its staff, encouraging them to question and challenge GenAI-driven decisions that they believe are unfair or inaccurate. This requires providing staff with training on ethical considerations in AI and creating a safe and supportive environment for raising concerns.

In conclusion, ensuring transparency and accountability in GenAI decision-making is essential for building trust and promoting ethical implementation within the UNSD. By implementing robust mechanisms for documenting decisions, explaining rationales, establishing clear lines of responsibility, and providing avenues for appeal, the UNSD can ensure that GenAI is used responsibly and ethically to support its mission. The following section will explore the future of GenAI in official statistics, examining emerging trends and opportunities for further innovation.



### <a id="53-the-future-of-genai-in-official-statistics-trends-and-opportunities"></a>5.3 The Future of GenAI in Official Statistics: Trends and Opportunities

#### <a id="531-emerging-genai-technologies-and-their-potential-applications"></a>5.3.1 Emerging GenAI Technologies and Their Potential Applications

The landscape of Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly evolving, with new technologies and applications emerging at an accelerating pace. For the UN Statistics Division (UNSD), staying abreast of these developments is crucial for identifying opportunities to further enhance official statistics and address emerging data needs. This section will explore some of the most promising emerging GenAI technologies and their potential applications within the UNSD, building upon the foundational knowledge and ethical framework established in earlier chapters.

One key trend is the development of more powerful and efficient GenAI models. Researchers are constantly working to improve the performance of existing models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), as well as developing entirely new architectures. These advancements are leading to models that can generate more realistic and coherent data, require less training data, and operate with greater energy efficiency. This has significant implications for the UNSD, as it can enable the use of GenAI in resource-constrained environments and for tasks that require high levels of accuracy and reliability.

Another important trend is the increasing focus on multimodal GenAI. Traditional GenAI models typically focus on generating data of a single type, such as text or images. However, emerging multimodal models can generate data across multiple modalities, such as text, images, audio, and video. This opens up new possibilities for official statistics, such as generating multimedia reports that combine text, charts, and images to communicate statistical findings more effectively. It also allows for the integration of diverse data sources, such as satellite imagery, social media feeds, and sensor data, to create a more comprehensive picture of the phenomena being studied.

The external knowledge highlights the potential of GenAI for various applications, including environmental monitoring, waste management, and data analysis. Emerging GenAI technologies are likely to further enhance these capabilities, enabling more sophisticated and automated solutions for these tasks. For example, GenAI could be used to develop more accurate and detailed models of climate change, allowing for better predictions of future impacts and more effective mitigation strategies. It could also be used to optimise waste management systems, reducing waste generation and improving recycling rates.

Furthermore, the development of more explainable and trustworthy GenAI models is a critical area of research. As discussed in Chapter 2, transparency and accountability are essential for building trust in GenAI-generated statistics. Emerging techniques for explainable AI (XAI) are making it easier to understand how GenAI models make decisions, allowing users to identify potential biases and errors. This is particularly important in high-stakes applications, such as those used for informing policy decisions or allocating resources.

The rise of federated learning, as touched upon in Section 4.2, presents another significant opportunity. This approach allows GenAI models to be trained on decentralised data sources without transferring the data to a central location, protecting data privacy and security. This is particularly valuable for the UNSD, as it allows for the use of GenAI in situations where data is sensitive or subject to strict privacy regulations.

Quantum computing, while still in its early stages of development, has the potential to revolutionise GenAI. Quantum computers can perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers, potentially enabling the training of much larger and more complex GenAI models. This could lead to breakthroughs in areas such as natural language processing, image recognition, and data analysis. However, quantum computing also poses new challenges for data security, as it could potentially break existing encryption algorithms. Therefore, the UNSD must carefully consider the security implications of quantum computing as it explores its potential applications in GenAI.

The external knowledge also emphasizes the importance of addressing challenges related to reliability, traceability, transparency, robustness, security, safety, accountability, ethics, and privacy. Emerging GenAI technologies should be developed and deployed in a way that addresses these challenges, ensuring responsible and ethical use. This requires a multi-disciplinary approach, involving data scientists, statisticians, ethicists, and policymakers.

In conclusion, the future of GenAI in official statistics is bright, with numerous emerging technologies and applications offering the potential to further enhance data quality, efficiency, and accessibility. By staying abreast of these developments, addressing the associated challenges, and adhering to ethical guidelines, the UNSD can unlock the full potential of GenAI to support its mission and contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.

- Sharing Data and Code: Making data and code publicly available, where possible, to facilitate research and development in GenAI. This requires careful consideration of data privacy and security, as discussed in Section 4.2, but can significantly accelerate progress in the field.
- Establishing Partnerships: Forming partnerships with other organisations, such as universities, research institutions, and private sector companies, to leverage their expertise and resources in GenAI. These partnerships can provide access to cutting-edge technologies, skilled personnel, and valuable data.
- Promoting Interdisciplinary Collaboration: Encouraging statisticians and data scientists to work together on GenAI projects, combining their expertise to develop innovative solutions. This requires fostering a culture of mutual respect and understanding between different disciplines.

The external knowledge highlights the importance of international collaboration and knowledge sharing as the official statistics community navigates this rapidly evolving landscape. The UNSD should actively participate in international initiatives, such as the High-Level Group for the Modernisation of Official Statistics (HLG-MOS) projects, to share its experiences and learn from others. The external knowledge also mentions the UN Global Platform for e-learning and knowledge sharing in statistics, which the UNSD should leverage to disseminate information and training materials on GenAI.

Furthermore, the external knowledge emphasizes the influence of the open-source movement in AI development, promoting access to tools and knowledge sharing. The UNSD should actively support and contribute to open-source GenAI projects, fostering a collaborative and transparent environment for innovation.

The UN Statistics Division (UNSD) plays a central role in the global statistical system, focusing on the collection, processing, and dissemination of statistical information across various domains. It also develops standards and norms for statistical activities and assists countries in strengthening their national statistical systems. The SDMX (Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange) initiative is exploring how GenAI can improve access to official statistics disseminated via SDMX services. The goal is to make data more accessible through natural language techniques, potentially through an AI-enabled universal data concierge. The IMF, in collaboration with EPAM, has launched StatGPT, a GenAI application for global economic data, to SDMX sponsor organizations. StatGPT 2.0 introduces a new approach to data accessibility and user interaction, allowing users to access and engage with economic and financial data using natural language. These are examples of how the UNSD can collaborate with other organizations to foster knowledge sharing.

To facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing, the UNSD should establish a central repository for GenAI resources, including data, code, models, and documentation. This repository should be easily accessible to all staff members and should be regularly updated with new information. The UNSD should also create a platform for showcasing successful GenAI projects, highlighting the benefits of these technologies and encouraging others to adopt them.

> The key to success in GenAI is not just about having the best technology, it's about having the best people and the best culture of collaboration and knowledge sharing, says a senior government official.

In conclusion, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing is essential for the long-term success of GenAI in official statistics. By creating opportunities for statisticians, data scientists, policymakers, and other stakeholders to connect, share their experiences, and learn from each other, the UNSD can accelerate innovation, mitigate risks, and ensure that GenAI benefits all stakeholders. This collaborative approach, combined with the technological infrastructure, data governance policies, and capacity building programs discussed earlier, will pave the way for a future where GenAI is used effectively to enhance official statistics and support the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. This marks the culmination of our strategic roadmap, providing a comprehensive framework for the UNSD to navigate the evolving landscape of GenAI and harness its transformative potential for the benefit of the global community.
