Generative AI (GenAI) represents a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, moving beyond traditional predictive models to systems capable of creating new content. For Advice Cloud, understanding the nuances of GenAI – its models, techniques, and applications – is fundamental to crafting a robust strategy for the public sector. This section provides a comprehensive overview, setting the stage for exploring its relevance and potential impact on Advice Cloud's service offerings and its clients' operations.

At its core, GenAI leverages machine learning algorithms to learn patterns from existing data and then generate new data that shares similar characteristics. Unlike discriminative models that classify data, generative models understand the underlying structure of the data, enabling them to create novel examples. This capability opens up a wide range of possibilities for automating tasks, enhancing creativity, and improving decision-making across various sectors, including the public sector.

Several key techniques and models underpin GenAI's capabilities. These include:

- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** GANs involve two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, that compete against each other. The generator creates new data, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and generated data. This adversarial process drives the generator to produce increasingly realistic outputs.
- **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** VAEs learn a compressed representation of the input data and then use this representation to generate new data. They are particularly useful for generating data with specific characteristics or styles.
- **Transformers:** Transformers are a type of neural network architecture that excels at processing sequential data, such as text and code. They are the foundation for many state-of-the-art GenAI models, including GPT-3 and other large language models.

Understanding these different approaches is essential for Advice Cloud to advise its clients effectively.

In the UK, the approach to AI regulation is primarily based on soft law, with a principles-based and cross-sectoral framework in place. This framework is built upon five core principles:

- Safety, security, and robustness
- Appropriate transparency and explainability
- Fairness
- Accountability and governance
- Contestability and redress

Existing regulators, such as the ICO, Ofcom, and FCA, will implement the framework within their sectors, using existing laws and issuing supplementary guidance. The UK government plans to introduce legislation in 2025 to address AI risks, potentially making voluntary agreements with AI developers legally binding. The UK's soft-law approach doesn't provide a formal definition of AI; sectoral interpretations will be based on system outcomes and characteristics like adaptability and autonomy.

The UK framework emphasizes collaboration between government, regulators, and industry to facilitate AI innovation. The National AI Strategy, launched in September 2021, aims to position the UK as a global leader in AI, focusing on investing in AI research and innovation, building skills through education and training programs, and promoting AI adoption by businesses. The AI Action Plan, launched in January 2025, outlines steps to boost economic efficiency and growth, including AI growth zones and a National Data Library.

In contrast, the EU has adopted a more prescriptive approach with the AI Act, the world's first comprehensive legal framework for AI. The AI Act takes a risk-based approach, applying different rules based on the risk posed by AI systems. It introduces a risk-based classification for AI applications, ranging from minimal risk to banned applications. The Act applies to various operators in the AI value chain, including providers, deployers, importers, distributors, and product manufacturers, even if they are located outside the EU, if the AI system's output is intended for use within the EU.

The AI Act includes key requirements such as the prohibition of certain AI practices deemed to pose unacceptable risk, standards for developing and deploying high-risk AI systems, and rules for general-purpose AI (GPAI) models. High-risk AI systems are subject to extensive obligations, particularly for providers, and cover areas such as risk management, data and data governance, technical documentation, record keeping, transparency and user information, human oversight, accuracy, robustness, cybersecurity, quality management, and fundamental rights impact assessment. The Act also includes disclosure obligations to ensure humans are informed when interacting with AI systems.

Penalties for non-compliance with the AI Act can range from EUR 7.5 million or 1.5% of worldwide annual turnover to EUR 35 million or 7% of worldwide annual turnover. The AI Act entered into force on August 1, 2024, with different provisions becoming applicable at different times: prohibitions and AI literacy obligations from February 2, 2025; governance rules and obligations for general-purpose AI models from August 2, 2025; and rules for high-risk AI systems embedded in regulated products from August 2, 2027.

The key differences between the UK and EU approaches are that the UK favours a flexible, 'soft law' approach that empowers existing regulators, while the EU has adopted a more prescriptive, risk-based legal framework with the AI Act. The EU AI Act provides a formal definition of AI, while the UK does not.
