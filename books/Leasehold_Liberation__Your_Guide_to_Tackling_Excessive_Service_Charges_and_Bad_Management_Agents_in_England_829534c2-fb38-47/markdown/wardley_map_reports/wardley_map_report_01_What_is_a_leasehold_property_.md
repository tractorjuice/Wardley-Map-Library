- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Central to the entire system, subject to inertia which may slow down reform efforts

### Freehold Ownership

- **Position:** [0.95, 0.75], highest visibility and high maturity
- **Evolution Stage:** Commodity (+utility)
- **Strategic Significance:** Foundational element of the property system, also subject to inertia

### Leasehold Reform

- **Position:** [0.20, 0.10], low visibility and in genesis stage
