## Map Overview

This Wardley Map depicts the process and components involved in analyzing service charge statements for leaseholders. It shows the journey from receiving a statement to potentially resolving disputes, highlighting key skills, tools, and legal considerations along the way.

**Anchor:** The anchor (user need) is the Leaseholder, positioned at the top right of the map. This signifies that the entire process and all other components exist to serve the leaseholder's need to understand and manage their service charges effectively.

## Component Analysis

### Leaseholder

- **Position:** High visibility, high value
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Central to the entire process; all other components serve this need

### Service Charge Statement

- **Position:** High visibility, mid-value
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Key artifact that initiates the analysis process

### Analysis Skills

- **Position:** Mid visibility, mid-value
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built (evolving towards Product)
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for effective interpretation of statements

### Dispute Resolution

- **Position:** Low visibility, low value
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built (evolving towards Product)
- **Strategic Significance:** Important for addressing discrepancies, but ideally avoided

### Legal Rights

- **Position:** High visibility, low value
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Foundational knowledge for leaseholders
