## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the process and components involved in a leaseholder challenging service charges, from initial review to potential tribunal hearings.

**Anchor:** The anchor is the Leaseholder, representing the user need to challenge potentially excessive service charges. This is significant as it drives the entire process and highlights the importance of leaseholder rights and protections.

## Component Analysis

### Leaseholder

- **Position:** High visibility, high ubiquity
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis
- **Strategic Significance:** Central to the entire process, representing the user need and driving all other components

### Service Charge Review

- **Position:** High visibility, moderate ubiquity
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical first step in the challenge process, setting the direction for subsequent actions

### Tribunal Hearing

- **Position:** Low visibility, low ubiquity
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Represents the final, formal stage of dispute resolution, with significant impact on outcomes

### Legal Framework

- **Position:** Low visibility, high ubiquity
- **Evolution Stage:** Commodity
- **Strategic Significance:** Underpins the entire process, providing structure and rules for all other components

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a progression from custom, leaseholder-specific activities towards more standardized and commoditized components as the challenge process becomes more formal.
