## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the evolution of complaint handling processes in leasehold management, from initial submission to continuous improvement.

**Anchor:** Leaseholders are the anchor, representing the primary user need for effective complaint handling in leasehold management.

## Component Analysis

### Leaseholders

- **Position:** High visibility, low evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical as the primary user and driver of the entire system

### Complaint Submission

- **Position:** High visibility, mid-high evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Key touchpoint for leaseholders, crucial for system effectiveness

### Investigation Process

- **Position:** Mid visibility, mid evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Core process for resolving complaints, potential for standardization

### Continuous Improvement

- **Position:** Low visibility, low evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for long-term system effectiveness, currently underdeveloped
