## Map Overview

This Wardley Map outlines the process and components involved in forming and registering a residents' association, from initial interest gauging to achieving collective bargaining power.

**Anchor:** The anchor is 'Leaseholders', representing the primary user need. This is significant as it places the leaseholders' interests at the center of the association formation process.

## Component Analysis

### Leaseholders

- **Position:** High visibility, low evolution (0.95, 0.79)
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis
- **Strategic Significance:** As the anchor, this component drives the entire process and highlights the importance of resident engagement throughout.

### Legal Recognition

- **Position:** Low visibility, higher evolution (0.40, 0.25)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built, evolving towards Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for legitimacy and effectiveness of the association, enabling collective action.

### Service Charge Challenges

- **Position:** Low visibility, highest evolution (0.30, 0.15)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product, evolving towards Commodity
- **Strategic Significance:** Represents a key outcome and benefit of forming the association, directly addressing leaseholder concerns.

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a clear progression from genesis (leaseholder interest) to more evolved components (legal recognition and service charge challenges), indicating a maturing process for association formation.

### Key Evolving Components
- Legal Recognition
- Collective Bargaining Power
- Service Charge Challenges

### Disruption Risks
- Communication Channels
- Registration with Bodies

## Value Chain Analysis

Value flows from leaseholder interest through organizational steps to achieve legal recognition and ultimately service charge challenges.

### Critical Paths
- Interest Gauging -> Initial Meeting -> Constitution -> Recognition Application -> Legal Recognition

### Bottlenecks
- Recognition Application
- Landlord Notification

## Strategic Positioning

The positioning shows a logical progression from high visibility, low evolution components to more evolved, lower visibility components, aligning with the maturation of the association.

### Misalignments
- Communication Channels could be positioned earlier in the process for better engagement

## Competitive Analysis
