## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the Right to Manage (RTM) qualification process and potential obstacles for leaseholders seeking to take control of their property management. It shows the journey from leaseholders initiating an RTM claim through various qualifying criteria and potential obstacles, ultimately leading to management transition.

**Anchor:** The anchor (user need) is 'Leaseholders', positioned at the top-left of the map. This represents the primary stakeholders seeking to exercise their Right to Manage, driving the entire process and value chain.

## Component Analysis

### RTM Claim

- **Position:** Positioned in the Custom-Built quadrant, indicating a tailored process for each case
- **Evolution Stage:** Evolving towards Product (0.75 on evolution axis)
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical component bridging leaseholders' needs with legal and practical requirements

### Qualifying Criteria

- **Position:** Pipeline in the Product/Rental quadrant, representing standardized requirements
- **Evolution Stage:** Product stage, indicating established criteria
- **Strategic Significance:** Key determinant of RTM claim viability, potential area for streamlining

### Potential Obstacles

- **Position:** Pipeline in the Genesis/Custom-Built quadrant, indicating varied and evolving challenges
- **Evolution Stage:** Early stage, suggesting ongoing adaptation and mitigation strategies needed
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical area for risk management and process improvement

### Community Engagement

- **Position:** In the Custom-Built quadrant, reflecting tailored approaches
- **Evolution Stage:** Evolving towards Product (0.60 on evolution axis)
- **Strategic Significance:** Vital for achieving participation threshold and overcoming leaseholder apathy

### Professional Guidance

- **Position:** In the Product quadrant, indicating established expertise
- **Evolution Stage:** Highly evolved (0.80 on evolution axis)
- **Strategic Significance:** Essential for navigating complex legal and financial aspects of RTM
