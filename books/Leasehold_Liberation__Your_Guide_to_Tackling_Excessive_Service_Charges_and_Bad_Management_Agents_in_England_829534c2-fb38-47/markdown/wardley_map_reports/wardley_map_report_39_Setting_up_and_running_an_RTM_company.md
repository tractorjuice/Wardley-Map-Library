## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the components and relationships involved in setting up and managing an RTM company, which allows leaseholders to take control of their property management from freeholders.

**Anchor:** The anchor (user need) is 'Leaseholders', positioned at the top right of the map. This represents the end-users who are seeking to establish and benefit from an RTM company, driving the entire value chain.

## Component Analysis

### RTM Company

- **Position:** Central to the map, in the Custom-Built phase
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-Built (0.75 on evolution axis)
- **Strategic Significance:** Core component that connects leaseholders to various legal, operational, and management aspects. Its position suggests it's becoming more standardized but still requires customization for each property.

### Property Management

- **Position:** High on the value chain, spanning from Product to Commodity
- **Evolution Stage:** Ranges from Product (0.45) to Commodity (0.85)
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical function with varying levels of maturity, indicating potential for both customization and standardization in management approaches.

### Legal Framework

- **Position:** High on the value chain, in the Product phase
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (0.55 on evolution axis)
- **Strategic Significance:** Provides the necessary legal structure for RTM companies, still requiring some specialization but moving towards standardization.

### Governance Practices

- **Position:** Lower on the value chain, in the Custom-Built phase
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-Built (0.45 on evolution axis)
- **Strategic Significance:** Crucial for effective RTM company operation, but still highly customized, indicating potential for standardization and best practices development.

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a system in transition, with core components like the RTM Company and Property Management evolving towards more standardized forms, while supporting elements like Governance Practices and Communication are still in earlier evolutionary stages.

### Key Evolving Components
- RTM Company
- Property Management
- Communication

### Disruption Risks
- Financial Systems
- Service Providers
- Maintenance Planning

## Value Chain Analysis

Value flows from the Leaseholders through the RTM Company, which then coordinates various management, legal, and operational aspects. The RTM Company acts as a central hub, connecting leaseholders to property management services and interfacing with the freeholder.

### Critical Paths
- Leaseholders -> RTM Company -> Property Management
- RTM Company -> Legal Framework
- RTM Company -> Transition Process -> Financial Systems

### Bottlenecks
- Governance Practices
- Transition Process
- RTM Notice

## Strategic Positioning

The RTM Company is well-positioned as a central coordinating entity. However, the varying evolutionary stages of different components suggest opportunities for optimization and standardization, particularly in areas like Governance Practices and Maintenance Planning.
