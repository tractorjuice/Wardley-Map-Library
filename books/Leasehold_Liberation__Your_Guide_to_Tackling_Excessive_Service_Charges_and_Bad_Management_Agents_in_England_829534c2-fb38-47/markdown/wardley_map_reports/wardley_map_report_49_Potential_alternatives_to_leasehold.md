## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the evolution of property ownership models in England, focusing on alternatives to the traditional leasehold system. It shows various components of the property ecosystem, from homeowners and properties to different ownership models and supporting elements like legal frameworks and public awareness.

**Anchor:** The anchor (user need) is the Homeowner, positioned at the top right of the map. This signifies that the entire system revolves around meeting the needs and desires of homeowners, which is crucial for understanding the dynamics of property ownership models.

## Component Analysis

### Leasehold

- **Evolution Stage:** Late Product (+rental), evolving towards Commodity
- **Strategic Significance:** Currently dominant but under pressure to evolve due to its position and connection to Developer Interests

### Commonhold

- **Position:** Left-center, suggesting it's a newer, less established model
- **Evolution Stage:** Early Product, with potential for rapid evolution
- **Strategic Significance:** Represents a significant alternative to leasehold, with potential for growth and adoption

### Expanded Freehold

- **Position:** Left side, indicating a novel concept
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis/Custom-Built
- **Strategic Significance:** Potential future evolution of freehold to address multi-unit property issues

### Government Policy

- **Position:** Bottom-center, foundational to the system
- **Evolution Stage:** Early Product, evolving towards Late Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical in shaping the future of property ownership models
