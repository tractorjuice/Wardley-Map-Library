## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the transition from legacy IT infrastructure to more sustainable, green technologies in software development and operations. It shows a range of components from user needs to specific technologies and practices, positioned along axes of value chain and evolution.

**Anchor:** The anchor is 'User Needs', positioned at the top of the value chain. This signifies that all other components ultimately serve to meet user requirements, emphasizing the importance of user-centric design in the transition to green technologies.

## Component Analysis

### Cloud Solutions

- **Position:** High on the value chain, mid-evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Key enabler for the transition to green technologies, offering scalability and potentially better energy efficiency than on-premises solutions.

### Microservices

- **Position:** Mid-value chain, early product stage
- **Evolution Stage:** Early Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Enables more efficient resource utilization and easier updates, supporting the transition to greener practices.

### Green Coding Practices

- **Position:** Lower on value chain, early product stage
- **Evolution Stage:** Early Product
