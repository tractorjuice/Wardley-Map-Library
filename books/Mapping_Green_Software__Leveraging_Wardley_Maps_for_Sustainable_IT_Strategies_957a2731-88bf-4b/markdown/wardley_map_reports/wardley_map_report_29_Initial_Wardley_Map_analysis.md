## Map Overview

This Wardley Map represents the components and value chain of a data centre, focusing on optimisation opportunities. It spans from user needs to underlying infrastructure and operational processes.

**Anchor:** The anchor is 'User Needs', positioned at the top right. This signifies that all other components ultimately serve to meet user requirements for data processing, storage, and accessibility.

## Component Analysis

### User Needs

- **Position:** Top right (0.95, 0.95)
- **Evolution Stage:** Fully evolved
- **Strategic Significance:** Drives all other components; critical to align all strategies with user requirements

### Servers

- **Position:** Middle (0.65, 0.55)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Core infrastructure component; key area for optimisation efforts

### Cooling Systems

- **Position:** Middle-left (0.60, 0.50)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (with inertia)
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for efficiency; marked for evolution, indicating potential for innovation

### Energy Supply

- **Position:** Bottom-right (0.85, 0.25)
- **Evolution Stage:** Commodity (+utility)
- **Strategic Significance:** Essential input; opportunity for sustainability improvements

### Bespoke Systems

- **Position:** Bottom-left (0.20, 0.30)
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis (with inertia)
- **Strategic Significance:** Potential source of competitive advantage; marked for significant evolution
