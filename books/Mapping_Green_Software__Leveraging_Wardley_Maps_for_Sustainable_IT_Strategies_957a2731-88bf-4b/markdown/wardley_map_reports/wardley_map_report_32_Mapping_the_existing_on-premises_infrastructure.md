- **Evolution Stage:** Early, with a pipeline indicating ongoing development
- **Strategic Significance:** Key strategic initiative for achieving sustainability goals and modernizing infrastructure. Its early stage suggests significant potential for innovation and optimization.

### Energy Consumption

- **Position:** [0.30, 0.55] - Genesis/Custom-Built
- **Evolution Stage:** Very early (0.15 evolution)
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical focus area for sustainability efforts. Its early evolution stage indicates significant room for improvement and innovation in energy management.

### Carbon Footprint

- **Position:** [0.25, 0.50] - Genesis/Custom-Built
- **Evolution Stage:** Earliest stage (0.10 evolution)
- **Strategic Significance:** Directly linked to sustainability goals. Its very early stage suggests it's a new focus area with substantial potential for improvement and strategic importance.

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a mix of well-evolved infrastructure components (servers, storage, networking) and early-stage strategic initiatives (cloud migration, energy consumption management). This indicates a transition phase from traditional on-premises infrastructure to more sustainable and potentially cloud-based solutions.
