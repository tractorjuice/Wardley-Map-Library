## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the ecosystem of green software standards and certifications, showing the relationships between software development practices, sustainability metrics, and emerging industry standards.

**Anchor:** The anchor is Green Software Development, representing the core user need for sustainable software practices. Its high visibility and low maturity indicate growing demand but still-evolving methodologies.

## Component Analysis

### Green Software Development

- **Position:** High visibility (0.65) and custom-built (0.89)
- **Evolution Stage:** Early Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Central to the map, driving demand for standards and metrics

### Sustainability Metrics

- **Position:** Moderate visibility (0.55) and product (0.78)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for quantifying and improving software sustainability

### SCI Specification

- **Position:** Low visibility (0.45) and early product (0.70)
- **Evolution Stage:** Early Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Emerging standard for carbon efficiency, poised for growth

### Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact

- **Position:** Low visibility (0.35) and early product (0.60)
- **Evolution Stage:** Early Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Important for data center sustainability, but still emerging

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a landscape in transition, with many components in the product stage but evolving at different rates. Standards and certifications are generally less evolved than the practices they aim to regulate.

### Key Evolving Components
- SCI Specification
- Emerging Standards
- Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact

### Disruption Risks
- Adopted Certifications
- ISO/IEC 23001-11:2019

## Value Chain Analysis
