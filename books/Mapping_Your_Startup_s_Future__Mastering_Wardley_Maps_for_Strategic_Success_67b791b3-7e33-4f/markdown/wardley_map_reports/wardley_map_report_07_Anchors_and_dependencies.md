## Map Overview

This Wardley Map depicts the landscape for a GovTech startup focusing on public sector procurement. It shows the relationship between government agencies, procurement processes, and the startup's solution, along with various supporting components.

**Anchor:** The anchor is 'User Needs', positioned at [0.95, 0.79]. This represents the primary driver for the entire system - the needs of government agencies in procurement processes. Its high visibility and low evolution indicate that these needs are well-known but still largely unmet by current solutions.

## Component Analysis

### Government Agencies

- **Position:** High visibility (0.90) and relatively high evolution (0.75)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Key customer and primary user of the procurement system. Their position indicates they are well-established but still evolving in their procurement needs and practices.

### Procurement Process

- **Position:** Moderate visibility (0.65) and evolution (0.55)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Core focus area for improvement. Its position suggests significant opportunity for innovation and efficiency gains.

### Legacy Systems

- **Position:** Low visibility (0.55) and evolution (0.45)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Represents existing infrastructure that may hinder innovation. Marked with 'inertia', indicating resistance to change.

### Startup Solution

- **Position:** Moderate visibility (0.45) and evolution (0.50)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** The startup's offering, positioned to disrupt the current procurement process by leveraging emerging technologies and addressing inefficiencies.

### Emerging Technologies

- **Position:** Low visibility (0.30) but moderate evolution (0.40)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Represents potential for innovation and disruption in the procurement process. Key area for the startup to leverage for competitive advantage.

## Evolution Analysis
