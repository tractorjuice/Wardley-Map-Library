## Map Overview

This Wardley Map represents the initial landscape of a fintech startup, likely in the peer-to-peer lending space. It shows key components ranging from user-facing elements to backend systems and regulatory considerations.

**Anchor:** The anchor is 'User Need', positioned at the top right, indicating high visibility and high value to users. This is crucial as it drives the entire value chain and justifies the startup's existence.

## Component Analysis

### Mobile App

- **Position:** High visibility, custom-built
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical interface for user interaction, key differentiator

### Credit Scoring Algorithm

- **Position:** Lower visibility, higher uniqueness
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built, evolving towards product
- **Strategic Significance:** Core competitive advantage, critical for risk management

### Regulatory Compliance

- **Position:** Lower visibility, necessary component
- **Evolution Stage:** Product, with inertia
- **Strategic Significance:** Essential for operation, potential barrier to entry
