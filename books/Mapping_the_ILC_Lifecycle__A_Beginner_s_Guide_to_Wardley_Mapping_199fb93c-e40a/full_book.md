## <a id="foundations-of-wardley-mapping-and-the-ilc-lifecycle"></a>Foundations of Wardley Mapping and the ILC Lifecycle

### <a id="introduction-to-wardley-mapping"></a>Introduction to Wardley Mapping

#### <a id="what-is-wardley-mapping"></a>What is Wardley Mapping?

Wardley Mapping is a visual strategic tool that captures how organisational activities and technologies evolve over time. By plotting a value chain against stages of evolution, it enables leaders to understand dependencies, allocate resources effectively and anticipate market shifts.

- **Users** – The personas or organisations that consume services or products
- **Needs** – The specific requirements or outcomes that users seek to achieve
- **Capabilities** – The activities, practices or technologies required to satisfy user needs
- **Value Chain** – A dependency chain from user needs down to foundational components
- **Evolution Axis** – The progression from *Genesis* through *Custom Built*, *Product* and *Commodity*

At its core, Wardley Mapping follows the Strategy Cycle: clarify **purpose**, map the **landscape**, understand the **climate**, apply **doctrines**, and demonstrate **leadership**. This iterative process ensures that strategy remains aligned to real‑world dynamics rather than static assumptions.

- Encourages decisions based on empirical understanding rather than intuition
- Exposes hidden dependencies and potential single points of failure
- Highlights areas ripe for innovation or automation
- Facilitates clear communication across multidisciplinary teams
- Supports scenario planning by visualising possible evolution paths

Understanding what a Wardley Map is lays the groundwork for the ILC lifecycle. By recognising where components sit on the evolution axis, organisations can determine when to innovate, when to leverage existing solutions and when to commoditise for scale.

> Mapping landscapes reveals hidden dependencies and informs tactical decisions says a leading expert in the field



#### <a id="the-valuechain-yaxis"></a>The Value‑Chain Y‑Axis

In Wardley Mapping, the Y‑axis represents the value chain: the line of visibility from user needs down to the underlying components that support those needs. This axis is crucial to identifying dependencies and understanding how each element contributes to user value. By plotting components on the Y‑axis, strategists can see which activities are direct customer interactions and which operate behind the scenes.

- Components at the top are user‑facing: directly perceived by the user (interfaces, front‑end services)
- Components in the middle provide essential services but are less visible (APIs, middleware)
- Components at the bottom are foundational and often invisible (infrastructure, commodity utilities)
- This hierarchical structure clarifies how changes propagate from underlying layers to the user experience

To build the value‑chain axis, you start with the user or customer at the apex and then ask successively What does this need to exist? This approach ensures that every component plotted has a clear purpose in fulfilling user needs and exposes hidden single points of failure.

> A clear value chain unearths hidden dependencies and highlights where to focus innovation says a senior government official

In the ILC lifecycle, the Y‑axis guides when to Innovate, Leverage or Commoditise. Components higher on the value chain may require custom innovation to address emerging user needs, whereas lower‑level utilities often become candidates for commoditisation once maturity indicators are met.



#### <a id="the-evolution-xaxis"></a>The Evolution X‑Axis

The evolution axis is the horizontal dimension of a Wardley Map, showing how components progress from novel experiments to ubiquitous utilities. Understanding this axis is crucial for timing interventions, aligning with the ILC lifecycle and anticipating shifts in capability maturity within public sector environments.

- **Genesis** – Rare and bespoke solutions, highly uncertain with experimental value
- **Custom‑Built** – Emerging market solutions, increasing understanding and early adoption
- **Product/Rental** – Standardised offerings with competitive differentiation and growing ROI
- **Commodity/Utility** – Mature, high‑volume services where efficiency and cost control dominate

Movements on the X‑axis are shown by arrows indicating the natural drift of components as they mature. Inertia blocks can highlight barriers such as regulation or cultural resistance that delay evolution, while pipelines illustrate predictable paths from custom solutions to utility services.

By plotting components along the evolution axis, strategists can decide when to innovate in emerging areas, leverage existing products for refinement and scale, or commoditise mature services to drive cost efficiencies. Combined with the Y‑axis value chain, this insight directs decisions on resource allocation and timing across the ILC phases.

Scenario planning benefits from iterative updates to evolution positions, ensuring maps reflect real‑world shifts and guide leadership in applying doctrinal principles at the right maturity point.

> Timing is everything when components evolve; mapping their journey reveals the optimal moment to innovate, leverage or commoditise, says a senior government strategist



### <a id="building-your-first-map"></a>Building Your First Map

#### <a id="identifying-users-and-needs"></a>Identifying Users and Needs

Identifying users and needs is the foundation of any Wardley Map and the first step in the ILC lifecycle. By anchoring the map on well‑defined user personas and their outcomes, strategists ensure that every subsequent component, from innovative prototypes to commoditised utilities, aligns with real‑world demand and delivers value.

Begin by determining the primary user or stakeholder group whose requirements will drive your mapping exercise. In a public sector context, users may include citizens accessing services, front‑line staff implementing policy, or partner agencies collaborating on shared objectives. Defining this scope early prevents map sprawl and keeps focus sharp.

- Conduct stakeholder workshops to surface all parties interacting with the service
- Distinguish primary users (direct value exchangers) from secondary users (indirect beneficiaries)
- Develop user personas capturing key characteristics, motivations and pain points
- Validate personas through interviews, surveys or usage analytics
- Ensure alignment of user definitions with organisational purpose and statutory mandates

With users identified, articulate their needs as the top‑level elements of your value chain. Needs represent the outcomes users seek, not specific features. For example, a citizen may need rapid benefits determination, while a policy team might require real‑time analytics dashboards. Clear, outcome‑oriented needs drive the identification of capabilities and highlight where to innovate, leverage or commoditise within the ILC framework.

- Express needs in user language and avoid technical terms
- Link each need to measurable service outcomes or performance indicators
- Keep needs at a high level to prevent premature detail in early maps
- Review needs against strategic priorities and regulatory requirements
- Iterate need definitions through feedback loops with user representatives

> User centric mapping unearths hidden dependencies and guides targeted innovation says a senior government strategist



#### <a id="linking-components-in-the-value-chain"></a>Linking Components in the Value Chain

Linking components is the bridge between identifying user needs and visualising how those needs are fulfilled. By accurately mapping dependencies, strategists in the public sector can see how changes propagate through systems, anticipate bottlenecks and align efforts with the ILC lifecycle. This step ensures that every element of the value chain is purposefully connected and ready for innovation, leverage or commoditisation.

- Start with each top‑level need and ask What must exist to satisfy this need
- For each component, identify immediate upstream dependencies
- Classify each dependency as data, service, practice or knowledge
- Draw directional arrows to show flow of value or information
- Validate each link with domain experts to uncover hidden assumptions

When linking components, consider both the Y‑axis visibility and the X‑axis evolution stage. A genesis‑stage prototype may depend on custom‑built analytics, whereas a commodity utility will link to standardised infrastructure. This dual perspective ensures that links not only reflect current architecture but also highlight where the ILC cycle will trigger innovation or commoditisation next.

> A successful map reflects real‑world system complexity and evolves as understanding deepens says a senior government strategist

- Use clear arrowheads and consistent line styles to distinguish dependency types
- Annotate links with brief notes on performance, cost or risk where relevant
- Maintain a legend for symbols and colours to aid cross‑team collaboration
- Conduct mapping workshops to surface implicit connections and refine links
- Apply version control and date annotations to track the evolution of your map

Linking components is not a one‑off task but an iterative discipline. As new information emerges or components evolve along the ILC lifecycle, revisit your links to ensure the map remains an accurate, living representation of your strategic landscape.



#### <a id="determining-evolution-stages"></a>Determining Evolution Stages

Accurately positioning each component along the evolution axis is pivotal for guiding the ILC lifecycle. Building on our understanding of the X‑axis, this step transforms abstract value‑chain dependencies into actionable insights. By determining evolution stages, strategists can decide when to innovate, when to leverage existing solutions and when to commoditise for scale.

- Novelty and uncertainty – how experimental or well‑understood is the component?
- Customisation and predictability – is it built for a specific purpose or generically available?
- Standardisation and availability – how widely adopted and documented is the solution?
- Volume and cost pressure – does high usage drive economies of scale?
- Operational focus – is reliability and efficiency the dominant concern?

Begin by asking targeted questions about each component in your value chain. For example: **Is this capability a one‑off prototype or a repeatable service?** **Do we maintain deep in‑house expertise or rely on external providers?** These queries help distinguish between Genesis, Custom‑Built, Product and Commodity stages.

- Identify and list all components from your value chain map
- Evaluate each against evolution criteria (novelty, customisation, standardisation, cost)
- Assign a stage label (Genesis, Custom‑Built, Product, Commodity) on the X‑axis
- Annotate inertia or barriers such as regulation, culture or technology immaturity
- Draw movement arrows to indicate expected drift or planned interventions

Recognising barriers is as important as charting progress. Public sector projects often face regulatory constraints, skill shortages or funding cycles that slow evolution. Note these as **inertia blocks** to communicate risk and timing to stakeholders.

> Mapping evolution reveals the right moment to move from bespoke to standard utility, says a senior government strategist

Through iterative review and collaborative workshops, your map remains a living artefact. As components shift rightward, the ILC phases naturally follow: innovate in the Genesis and Custom‑Built zones, leverage in the Product zone and commoditise in the Utility zone.



### <a id="overview-of-the-ilc-model"></a>Overview of the ILC Model

#### <a id="innovateleveragecommoditise-explained"></a>Innovate‑Leverage‑Commoditise Explained

The Innovate‑Leverage‑Commoditise (ILC) model is a strategic play within Wardley Maps that guides organisations through a cycle of sensing opportunities, refining proven solutions and ultimately industrialising services at scale. Rooted in customer‑centric observation, the ILC approach reduces risk by building on what works and ensures that resources are focused where they deliver maximum value. In the public sector, this model provides a rigorous, empirically driven method to move from experimental prototypes to reliable utilities, aligning perfectly with the evolution axis of Wardley Mapping.

At its core, ILC is a sensing mechanism for ecosystem changes. By listening closely to early adopters, collecting data on usage patterns and iteratively refining capabilities, organisations can chart a clear path from novel innovation through productisation to commoditisation. This trajectory not only enhances competitive advantage but also enables scalable, cost‑effective service delivery for citizens and agencies.

### <a id="innovate-stage"></a>Innovate Stage

In the **Innovate** phase, organisations focus on Genesis and Custom‑Built components. This is where uncertainty is highest and experimentation is encouraged. By partnering with leading customers or pilot teams, governments can co‑create bespoke solutions that address emerging policy priorities or citizen needs.

- Observe and engage with early adopters to capture novel requirements
- Prototype rapidly using lean methods to validate hypotheses
- Embrace failure as a learning mechanism and document insights
- Map experimental components on the left of the evolution axis
- Annotate inertia blocks such as regulatory constraints or funding cycles

Effective sensing in this stage relies on ecosystem listening techniques, such as citizen juries, sandbox environments and hackathons. This ensures that innovation is demand‑driven rather than technology‑led.

### <a id="leverage-stage"></a>Leverage Stage

Once a solution demonstrates repeatable value, it enters the **Leverage** phase, corresponding to the Product stage on the evolution axis. Here, data collection and analysis become critical to refine features, optimise performance and identify standardisation opportunities.

- Collect quantitative metrics such as usage patterns, cost per transaction and performance SLAs
- Analyse customer feedback to prioritise feature enhancements
- Standardise common workflows while retaining configurable options
- Update the map regularly to reflect product maturity and shifting user needs
- Use agile iterations to refine both the capability and its position on the map

In government contexts, the Leverage stage may involve rolling out prototypes across multiple departments, integrating with existing platforms and ensuring interoperability with legacy systems.

### <a id="commoditise-stage"></a>Commoditise Stage

The **Commoditise** phase aligns with the Commodity/Utility stage in Wardley Maps. Here, the focus shifts to industrialisation: driving cost efficiencies, automating delivery and embedding services as ubiquitous back‑office utilities.

- Automate provisioning, monitoring and incident response through platform engineering
- Implement economies of scale to reduce per‑unit cost
- Establish clear governance models for security, compliance and data privacy
- Offer self‑service portals or APIs to empower internal teams and external partners
- Continuously monitor utility metrics and optimise for reliability

In this phase, public sector organisations may transition services to shared infrastructure, such as cloud platforms or national digital service frameworks, ensuring predictable cost structures and robust service levels.

### <a id="key-benefits-of-the-ilc-approach"></a>Key Benefits of the ILC Approach

- Customer‑Centric Innovation: Builds on proven needs to minimise product‑market misfit
- Risk Reduction: De‑risks investments by validating solutions before large‑scale deployment
- Competitive Advantage: Creates barriers to entry by iterating on real‑world use cases
- Resource Optimisation: Directs effort where it yields highest impact across the evolution curve
- Strategic Clarity: Visualises the lifecycle of components, informing timely decision‑making

> By letting the ecosystem tell you what works, you avoid wasted effort and focus on scaling what truly matters says a senior government strategist



#### <a id="how-ilc-aligns-with-wardley-maps"></a>How ILC Aligns with Wardley Maps

The Innovate‑Leverage‑Commoditise (ILC) model is inherently linked to the evolution axis of Wardley Maps. By plotting components along the X‑axis, organisations can visually identify where to apply each ILC phase, ensuring that strategies align with the maturity of capabilities and the value chain dependencies already mapped on the Y‑axis.

- Innovate phase corresponds to Genesis and Custom‑Built zones where uncertainty is highest and experimentation thrives
- Leverage phase maps to the Product/Rental zone, focusing on standardisation, performance optimisation and repeatable value
- Commoditise phase aligns with Commodity/Utility, driving industrialisation, cost efficiency and self‑service delivery
- The Y‑axis value chain clarifies which user‑facing or foundational components require innovation, refinement or automation

Integrating ILC into Wardley Mapping transforms a static landscape into a dynamic playbook. As components shift rightward, the map triggers sensing activities in the Innovate zone, data‑driven refinements in the Leverage zone and scaling tactics in the Commoditise zone. This continuous visual feedback loop reduces strategic guesswork and ensures interventions occur at the optimal maturity point.

> Aligning ILC with a Wardley Map clarifies strategic timing and reduces risk says a leading expert in the field



#### <a id="key-benefits-of-the-ilc-approach"></a>Key Benefits of the ILC Approach

The ILC approach provides a structured mechanism to transition from novel ideas to scalable utilities, reducing strategic uncertainty and ensuring resources are deployed where they deliver the greatest value. By aligning closely with real‑world usage patterns and proven customer solutions, ILC minimises waste and accelerates the path from concept to commodity.

- Risk‑Free Market Opportunity Capture by observing and replicating customer successes without heavy upfront investment
- Customer‑Centric Innovation that leverages validated needs, reducing the chance of product‑market misfit
- Competitive Advantage through rapid iteration on proven solutions, making it difficult for rivals to catch up
- Efficient Resource Allocation by focusing effort on leveraging and commoditising existing solutions rather than reinventing the wheel
- Early Identification of Market Opportunities via continuous sensing of usage data and billing metrics

These benefits resonate with core Wardley Mapping doctrines such as using empirical data to inform decisions and exploiting inertia to time interventions. By mapping each component’s maturity, organisations can apply ILC phases precisely—innovate at the genesis, leverage in the product stage and commoditise upon utility readiness.

> ILC ensures that every step from prototype to utility is validated by real‑world demand says a senior government strategist



## <a id="innovate-phase-spotting-and-mapping-emerging-innovations"></a>Innovate Phase: Spotting and Mapping Emerging Innovations

### <a id="genesis-and-custombuilt-components"></a>Genesis and Custom‑Built Components

#### <a id="characteristics-of-genesis-stage"></a>Characteristics of Genesis Stage

In the Innovate phase, the Genesis stage represents the left‑most frontier on your Wardley Map. Components here are embryonic, driven by user‑led experimentation and unrefined hypotheses. Understanding these characteristics allows public sector leaders to allocate resources for rapid prototyping while acknowledging high uncertainty and risk.

- Novel and Rare: Genesis components are unique or first‑of‑their‑kind, offering potential leaps in capability.
- Poorly Understood: Both technology and use cases lack clear definition, requiring deep discovery efforts.
- High Uncertainty and Risk: Success is far from assured and failure is expected as part of learning.
- Experimental and Theoretical: Solutions exist more as concepts or proofs of concept than production‑ready services.
- Competitive Advantage Potential: Early movers can shape standards and influence user expectations.

Aligning Genesis stage insights with the ILC model means deliberately focusing sensing activities here. Public sector organisations should embrace sandbox environments, citizen juries or hackathons to co‑create prototypes with early adopters. These interactions refine hypotheses and reveal hidden dependencies in the value chain.

- Engage Early Adopters: Partner with pilot departments or citizen groups to shape requirements.
- Document Learning: Capture both technical and regulatory obstacles as inertia blocks on your map.
- Adopt Minimum Viable Prototypes: Build just enough functionality to test key assumptions.
- Allocate Flexible Funding: Use contingency budgets or innovation grants to sustain rapid iteration.
- Plan for Pivot or Persevere: Define clear criteria for success, and be prepared to abandon unviable experiments.

> Innovation thrives where uncertainty is highest and failure is part of the learning journey says a senior government strategist

By charting these characteristics on your map, you create a visual playbook for the Innovate phase. The Genesis stage signals where to pilot bold ideas, while the subsequent Custom‑Built stage will absorb lessons learned and begin forming repeatable patterns.



#### <a id="characteristics-of-custombuilt-stage"></a>Characteristics of Custom‑Built Stage

**Custom‑Built** components occupy a crucial middle ground on the evolution axis, combining the bespoke innovation of Genesis with the emerging repeatability of Products. At this stage, organisations refine experimental solutions into tailored systems that address broader user needs, while still retaining the flexibility to adapt for specific contexts.

- Built to specific requirements but with growing modularity
- Improved predictability and documentation compared to Genesis prototypes
- Emerging best practices and reusable patterns
- Collaboration with external vendors or specialist teams
- Initial cost efficiencies through partial standardisation

Within the ILC lifecycle, the Custom‑Built stage marks the transition from pure **Innovate** to **Leverage**. Organisations scale successful experiments by formalising interfaces, refining performance, and codifying processes, preparing the component for productisation and eventual commoditisation.

- Establish governance frameworks to manage bespoke developments
- Ensure regulatory and compliance requirements are embedded early
- Develop clear integration points with legacy systems and ecosystem partners
- Create comprehensive documentation and training materials
- Iterate rapidly based on usage data and stakeholder feedback

For example, a government digital service may pilot a tailored workflow engine for benefits processing. After validating core functionality with a few local authorities, the team refines the solution architecture, establishes platform APIs and automates deployment pipelines—moving the capability firmly into the Custom‑Built domain.

> Tailoring solutions for unique departmental needs while planning for future standardisation is the hallmark of the Custom‑Built stage says a senior government strategist



### <a id="sensing-earlystage-innovation"></a>Sensing Early‑Stage Innovation

#### <a id="userdriven-experimentation"></a>User‑Driven Experimentation

User‑driven experimentation puts end‑users at the heart of the Innovate phase. By engaging citizens, front‑line staff and partner agencies early, public sector teams validate hypotheses and refine solutions in the Genesis and Custom‑Built zones.

- Recruit representative early adopters from diverse user groups
- Develop minimum viable prototypes to test core hypotheses
- Facilitate structured usability sessions and feedback workshops
- Capture both quantitative data and qualitative insights
- Iterate rapidly based on user feedback and map adjustments

This approach aligns with Wardley Mapping by anchoring experiments on the left of the evolution axis. Feedback loops inform the map, updating component positions and inertia blocks. Experiment outcomes guide transitions from Genesis to Custom‑Built, signalling when to shift from Innovate to Leverage.

> User involvement from day one reveals hidden needs and accelerates maturity, says a senior government strategist

In practice, public sector organisations may leverage regulatory sandboxes and digital service standards to create safe environments for experimentation. Collaborations with cross‑functional teams ensure prototypes meet compliance requirements while preserving agility. Documenting each iteration and mapping insights ensures transparency for stakeholders and informs funding decisions.



#### <a id="ecosystem-listening-techniques"></a>Ecosystem Listening Techniques

**Ecosystem Listening** is a proactive practice to monitor and scan the broader landscape for early signals of innovation, collaboration opportunities and emerging threats. In the Innovate phase of the ILC lifecycle, especially within public sector contexts, cultivating an ecosystem listening capability ensures that strategy is informed by real‑world dynamics rather than internal assumptions.

- Developing the capacity to notice spontaneous changes and patterns in policy, technology or user behaviour
- Gathering Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) from news outlets, official reports, job postings and social media
- Building models such as value chains and Wardley Maps to visualise the ecosystem
- Comparing new data against existing maps to spot movements or anomalies
- Applying the ILC technique: share useful artefacts, observe their adoption, harvest innovations to refine your offerings

Developing the capacity to notice requires dedicated routines. Regular horizon scans, cross‑departmental knowledge‑sharing sessions and innovation forums help teams to spot nascent shifts before competitors or adjacent agencies do.

OSINT is your amplification channel. Typical sources include:

- Government and industry publications highlighting pilot programmes and funding calls
- Academic papers and research collaborations in early‑stage technology domains
- Job listings revealing skill requirements and emerging roles
- Social media threads and professional networks discussing experimental projects
- Procurement portals and grant announcements signalling strategic priorities

Once intelligence is gathered, construct a visual model: map user needs, value‑chain components and their evolution stages. This living artefact becomes your baseline for comparison.

Comparing fresh inputs against your map uncovers where components are drifting. Look for subtle movements, such as a pilot proof‑of‑concept maturing into repeatable workflows, or infrastructure services attracting multiple vendors.

In the ILC context, ecosystem listening is more than passive monitoring. By publishing prototypes, APIs or data sets and inviting third‑party engagement, you create a feedback loop. Patterns of reuse, extensions or forks reveal high‑value innovations ready to be assimilated into your roadmap.

> By listening to the broader ecosystem you build early sensing engines and spot opportunities says a senior government strategist



### <a id="mapping-techniques-for-the-innovate-phase"></a>Mapping Techniques for the Innovate Phase

#### <a id="collaborative-workshops"></a>Collaborative Workshops

Collaborative workshops are the cornerstone of the Innovate phase, bringing together multidisciplinary teams to uncover user‑driven opportunities and surface genesis‑stage components on a Wardley Map. These sessions foster shared understanding, accelerate hypothesis validation and create a living artefact that guides the Innovate and subsequent ILC phases.

- Align on user personas and top‑level needs before mapping begins
- Reveal hidden dependencies and single points of failure
- Generate hypotheses for new or experimental components
- Assign roles for mapping, note‑taking and time‑keeping
- Create consensus on component placement along the evolution axis

Effective workshop design combines structure with creative freedom. Begin with a clear agenda, including ice‑breaker activities that centre on user needs. Allocate time for small‑group mapping exercises, then reconvene for plenary review. Use physical artefacts (sticky notes, coloured markers) or digital whiteboards to ensure everyone can contribute and the map evolves in real time.

- User‑need mapping: start by placing personas and needs at the top
- Dependency tracing: follow each need down to underlying activities
- Evolution placement: debate stage labels (Genesis, Custom‑Built, etc.)
- Inertia identification: mark regulatory or cultural constraints
- Dot voting: prioritise components for further prototyping

Whether in person or remote, establish clear norms: one conversation at a time, equal airtime for all voices, and explicit parking lots for off‑topic ideas. Select digital tools that support real‑time co‑editing, version control and easy export. After the workshop, capture photos or exports, annotate decisions and circulate a cleaned‑up map as a reference for the next Innovate sprint.

> Collaborative mapping workshops transform individual insights into strategic clarity by visualising where to innovate and why says a senior government strategist



#### <a id="using-templates-and-digital-tools"></a>Using Templates and Digital Tools

In the Innovate phase, templates and digital tools accelerate the mapping process by providing structure and enabling rapid iteration. They ensure consistency across workshops, capture essential details on hypotheses and inertia, and support remote or hybrid teams in real time.

- Paper templates for quick sketching and on‑the‑fly adjustments
- Google Slides or PowerPoint templates for familiar interfaces
- Miro and Mural boards with built‑in Wardley icons and guides
- Figma and OmniGraffle stencils for detailed visual control
- draw.io (Diagrams.net) templates for open‑source flexibility

Selecting the right template hinges on your team’s context and goals. In early experiments, low‑fidelity paper templates foster creative thinking without the burden of digital constraints. As concepts mature, transitioning to a collaborative digital board preserves audit trails, version history and annotation capabilities.

- Accessibility: ensure all participants can join workshops without friction
- Adaptability: choose templates that allow custom fields for hypotheses and data sources
- Version control: prefer tools with exportable history or branching support
- Annotation: look for sticky notes, comments and tagging features

Digital tools offer rich collaboration features. Real‑time cursors, integrated chat and voting plugins keep multidisciplinary teams aligned. Many platforms also support import/export of SVG or JSON maps, enabling seamless hand‑offs between strategists, developers and procurement teams.

- Miro: intuitive interface, Wardley Map template library, voting and timer plugins
- LucidChart: enterprise security, Visio import, granular permission controls
- draw.io: free, extensible icons, offline desktop and web versions
- MapScript: maps as code for integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Wardley Map Analyst (ChatGPT plugin): auto‑generate maps from text descriptions

Customising templates for the Innovate phase means adding fields for hypothesis statements, success criteria and regulatory constraints. This lightweight scaffolding captures experimental assumptions and informs the transition from Genesis toward Custom‑Built.

- Hypothesis column: what do we expect to learn or validate?
- Metrics field: which data points indicate progress or failure?
- Inertia block marker: where do regulations or culture slow evolution?
- Owner tag: who drives the experiment and consolidates feedback?

> Well‑designed templates transform mapping from guesswork into a repeatable process says a senior government strategist

Finally, leverage layering and colour‑coding in your digital tool to distinguish user needs, dependencies and evolution stages. Tags for workshops, dates and version numbers transform your map into a living artefact that evolves alongside the ILC lifecycle.



### <a id="tech-startup-case-study"></a>Tech Startup Case Study

#### <a id="scenario-and-map-walkthrough"></a>Scenario and Map Walk‑Through

In this case study we follow **HealthTech Innovators**, a startup in the Innovate phase building an AI‑driven personalised wellness platform. By walking through their Wardley Mapping process and applying ILC principles, we illustrate how to spot emerging innovations, validate hypotheses with users and prepare for scale.

- Identify the primary user (health‑conscious individuals) and their core need (customised wellness guidance)
- Build the value chain: Personalised Plan → AI Recommendation Engine → Data Collection → Fitness Tracker Integration → Dietary Database → Cloud Infrastructure → Raw Compute/Storage
- Assess each component against evolution criteria and place them on the X‑axis (e.g. engine in Genesis, database as Product, cloud as Commodity)
- Mark inertia blocks for compliance reviews and data governance that may slow down evolution
- Annotate hypotheses and success metrics for prototype components in the Genesis zone

During the workshop the team debated whether the AI engine belonged in **Genesis** or **Custom‑Built**, eventually placing it at the left edge to reflect high uncertainty. They used early adopter feedback from a pilot group to refine their hypothesis: could integrating continuous glucose monitoring shift the engine further into Custom‑Built? Mapping this revealed a new dependency on specialised sensor APIs.

### <a id="tracking-customerdriven-solutions"></a>Tracking Customer‑Driven Solutions

#### <a id="data-collection-methods"></a>Data Collection Methods

In the Leverage phase, robust data collection underpins the refinement of customer‑driven solutions. By systematically gathering quantitative and qualitative insights as components enter the **Product** stage, organisations can discern usage patterns, detect friction points and guide evolution towards commodity readiness. Effective data collection methods ensure that the ILC cycle is informed by real‑world evidence rather than assumptions.

Quantitative methods provide the numerical backbone for decision‑making, capturing objective signals of component performance and adoption. These metrics feed directly into map annotations, indicating areas where refinement is needed or where momentum supports commoditisation.

- Analytics dashboards tracking user journeys and conversion rates
- Performance metrics such as response times, error rates and uptime statistics
- Transaction and service consumption logs
- A/B and multivariate testing results to compare feature variants
- Automated error and exception reporting

Qualitative methods complement numbers with contextual understanding. By engaging frontline staff, citizen users and ecosystem partners, teams uncover hidden needs and emerging trends that may not appear in dashboards alone.

- Structured user interviews with frontline staff and citizen users
- Focus groups to explore pain points and emerging needs
- Usability testing sessions recorded and analysed for insights
- Open‑ended feedback forms and surveys
- Observational studies of service interactions in real‑world contexts

Aligning data collection with your Wardley Map maintains a live connection between metrics and components. Annotating map elements with key indicators, such as usage thresholds or error tolerances, clarifies when to iterate on design or push for broader rollout. To embed rigour and consistency, adopt these best practices:

- Ensure data governance and privacy compliance at every stage
- Integrate multiple data sources in a unified analytics platform
- Define clear metrics and indicators aligned with strategic objectives
- Maintain data quality through automated validation and cleansing
- Establish feedback loops between data teams and map owners

> Data‑driven refinement supports iterative map updates and accelerates pattern identification says a senior data strategist

By combining rigorous data collection with the Leverage phase’s focus on standardisation, public sector organisations can identify repeatable patterns, optimise resource allocation and ensure that customer‑driven solutions mature into high‑volume commodities with confidence.



#### <a id="success-metrics-and-indicators"></a>Success Metrics and Indicators

In the Leverage phase, success metrics and indicators provide the empirical feedback needed to refine customer‑driven solutions and guide components towards commodity readiness. By aligning quantitative and qualitative measures with your Wardley Map, teams ensure that iterative improvements are grounded in real‑world performance and user satisfaction.

- Customer Satisfaction (CSAT): Measures user perception and satisfaction with service refinements
- Net Promoter Score (NPS): Gauges loyalty and likelihood of recommendation among end users
- Customer Effort Score (CES): Tracks the ease with which users complete key tasks
- Adoption Rate: Percentage of target users engaging with the new capability over time
- Feature Utilisation: Frequency of use for specific features or workflows
- Service Performance SLAs: Metrics such as uptime, response times and error rates

ILC‑specific indicators help determine when to shift from Leverage to Commoditise by tracking maturity signals and momentum in product‑stage components.

- Repeatability Index: Measures consistency of outcomes across different user cohorts or departments
- Cost per Transaction: Trends in operational cost as adoption scales
- Time to Value: Average duration from user onboarding to tangible benefit
- Standardisation Readiness: Proportion of custom workflows converted into reusable templates
- Dependency Resilience: Stability of upstream components and third‑party services

Within your Wardley Map, annotate elements with evolution indicators to visualise progress and risks:

- Movement Arrows: Show velocity of components drifting towards Commodity
- Metric Badges: Attach small icons for CSAT, NPS or SLA compliance next to mapped items
- Inertia Blocks: Update regulatory, cultural or technical barriers that emerge during refinement
- Emerging Genesis Signals: Flag new experiments or extensions uncovered during user trials

To embed these metrics into your strategic practice, integrate real‑time dashboards with map review cycles and establish clear feedback loops between data teams and map owners.

- Define metric ownership and reporting cadence aligned to sprint or programme reviews
- Link dashboard widgets directly to map components for contextualised insights
- Set threshold triggers that automatically flag map updates when indicators cross predefined limits
- Conduct regular metric retrospectives to validate the continued relevance of chosen KPIs

> Data driven refinement supports iterative map updates and accelerates pattern identification says a senior public sector strategist



### <a id="maintaining-and-updating-maps"></a>Maintaining and Updating Maps

#### <a id="versioning-and-annotation"></a>Versioning and Annotation

Effective versioning and annotation turn a static Wardley Map into a dynamic, auditable artefact. In the Leverage phase, these practices ensure that refinements and emerging patterns are tracked, explained and easily revisited during subsequent map reviews.

- Maintain historical context of map evolution
- Enable rollback to previous hypotheses or configurations
- Provide transparency on why components shift positions
- Support collaborative editing across multidisciplinary teams
- Facilitate audit trails for governance and compliance

Several version control approaches can be adopted depending on team size and tool preferences. Consistency and discipline in naming and structuring versions are paramount.

- Date‑based naming conventions (e.g. wardley_map_20240701.drawio)
- Sequential numbering (e.g. wardley_map_v3)
- Git or VCS repositories for collaborative branching and merging
- Tagging releases with descriptive commit messages
- Automated changelog generation from commit history

Annotations capture the reasoning behind each map update. They transform a map from a visual snapshot into a narrative of strategic decisions and emerging insights.

- Inline text notes or callouts explaining component shifts
- Colour‑coding for risks, dependencies or priority changes
- Links to external documentation, data sources or user research
- Dedicated assumptions log capturing decisions and their rationale
- Legend entries for new symbols or evolution markers

Integrating versioning and annotation into the regular map review cycle ensures maps remain living artefacts. During each sprint or quarterly review, map owners should synchronise with data teams, update positions, annotate new insights and commit a new version.

- Pull latest map from repository and review recent changes
- Validate component placements against updated metrics and feedback
- Annotate new movements, barriers or dependency changes
- Increment version identifier and record change summary
- Push updated map and communicate release to stakeholders

> Annotations ensure that every shift on the map carries its backstory, making strategic intent explicit and traceable says a senior government strategist

By combining rigorous version control with comprehensive annotations, public sector teams can refine customer‑driven solutions with confidence, building a transparent trail of learning as components progress through the Leverage phase.



#### <a id="spotting-emerging-trends"></a>Spotting Emerging Trends

In the Leverage Phase, maintaining and updating Wardley Maps offers more than historical record‑keeping. By systematically spotting emerging trends within your evolving maps, public sector teams gain situational awareness and can pre‑emptively adjust strategies before bottlenecks or obsolescence arise.

- Regular horizon scans across policy briefings, procurement portals and industry reports
- Time‑series map snapshots to visualise component movement over successive review cycles
- Annotation of new climatic patterns such as regulation shifts, vendor consolidation or funding changes
- Version comparisons to identify unexpected drifts or acceleration in component evolution
- Integration of stakeholder feedback loops to surface nascent user needs and emerging service dependencies

These techniques build on established versioning and annotation practices by turning historical map data into forward‑looking insights. Tracking component velocity and inertia blocks in successive map versions allows teams to anticipate when to reinforce standardisation, optimise performance or move towards commoditisation.

> Spotted trends in map evolution often foreshadow strategic inflection points and inform proactive governance says a senior government strategist

Effective trend spotting transforms the map into a living radar, signalling when to refine services or pursue scale. Embedding these insights into regular review cycles closes the loop between data‑driven refinement and strategic decision‑making.



### <a id="identifying-repeatable-patterns"></a>Identifying Repeatable Patterns

#### <a id="standardisation-vs-customisation"></a>Standardisation vs. Customisation

In the Leverage phase, identifying repeatable patterns often hinges on striking the right balance between standardisation and customisation. Standardisation drives efficiency and cost‑control for components in the Product stage, while customisation ensures solutions remain aligned with unique user needs and local policy contexts. Understanding this trade‑off is essential for public sector leaders aiming to refine customer‑driven solutions and accelerate their evolution towards utility‑scale services.

- Standardisation creates uniform interfaces, documentation and support processes, reducing maintenance overhead.
- Customisation adapts workflows, data schemas or user interfaces to specific departmental requirements or regulatory constraints.
- Over‑standardisation can stifle innovation and fail to address local nuances; over‑customisation increases complexity and cost.

Within a Wardley Map, repeatable patterns emerge as components drift from Custom‑Built into the Product zone. In the Leverage phase, we observe which bespoke features customers reuse most often and standardise those into configurable modules. This approach aligns with ILC by using empirical data to guide which custom elements become part of a shared platform and which remain one‑off adaptations.

Public sector organisations must also consider procurement frameworks, interoperability standards and security requirements when balancing standardisation and customisation. Embedding policy compliance into shared services reduces approval cycles, while allowing configuration ensures that regional offices can meet statutory mandates without building entirely new systems.

- Adopt a modular architecture with well‑defined APIs, enabling custom extensions without forking the core service.
- Maintain a configuration registry that tracks local variants and their upgrade paths.
- Embed governance checkpoints in sprint reviews to validate that customisation does not introduce undue technical debt.
- Use feature toggles to pilot bespoke workflows before promoting them to a standard module.
- Regularly review usage metrics to identify which custom features have become de facto standards.

> Balancing modular standard building blocks with configurable extensions unlocks economies of scale while meeting unique policy needs says a senior government strategist

Consider a national digital identity service that began as bespoke solutions in multiple departments. By mapping common patterns—such as identity proofing, multi‑factor authentication and audit logging—the team extracted these into a standard platform. Local offices then configured branding and approval workflows without altering the core codebase, accelerating deployment and reducing support costs.

> Recognising repeatable patterns in service delivery accelerates the shift from pilot to platform says a public sector technology leader



#### <a id="transitioning-to-product-form"></a>Transitioning to Product Form

Moving components from bespoke implementations into a repeatable product form is a critical step in the Leverage phase. This transition captures the repeatable patterns identified during customer‑driven refinements and codifies them into standardised offerings that can be deployed consistently across departments and agencies.

- Catalogue frequently reused workflows and interfaces
- Define clear API contracts and service boundaries
- Establish versioning and release management processes
- Embed configuration options for local policy and regulatory needs
- Integrate monitoring, support and onboarding models

Formalising interfaces and APIs ensures that consumers of your product form experience predictable behaviour and integration points. In a public sector context, this often means aligning with interoperability standards and publishing comprehensive specification documents.

Defining configurable modules allows local teams to tailor the product form without forking the core codebase. Configuration registries or feature toggles enable rapid customisation within approved parameters, reducing technical debt and support overhead.

Governance and versioning underpin stability and trust. By adopting semantic versioning and publishing changelogs, teams provide transparency on enhancements, deprecations and compliance updates. Release cadences should align with funding cycles and policy review schedules.

- Use feature flags to pilot new modules before full release
- Publish a self‑service portal with sandbox environments
- Document upgrade paths and rollback procedures
- Define roles for product owners, stewards and support engineers
- Schedule regular reviews to incorporate emerging regulatory changes

> Turning repeatable patterns into a managed product offering creates economies of scale and predictable service levels says a senior government strategist



### <a id="integrating-agile-lean-and-design-thinking"></a>Integrating Agile, Lean and Design Thinking

#### <a id="lean-startup-for-hypothesis-testing"></a>Lean Startup for Hypothesis Testing

In the Leverage phase of the ILC lifecycle, Lean Startup principles provide a structured mechanism to refine product‑stage components through iterative experiments. By formulating and validating hypotheses, public sector teams can ensure that enhancements deliver real user value and drive components towards commodity readiness.

- Build‑Measure‑Learn loop to accelerate validated learning
- Formulating clear, testable hypotheses tied to map components
- Developing minimum viable enhancements rather than full features
- Collecting quantitative and qualitative metrics for decision‑making
- Using learning outcomes to pivot or persevere and update the map

Integrating hypothesis testing with Wardley Mapping means annotating your map with hypothesis statements, success criteria and measurement indicators. Each map review becomes an opportunity to assess whether experiments have shifted component maturity and to plan the next iteration of refinements.

- Define a hypothesis for a specific product‑stage component (for example, a new self‑service form)
- Attach success metrics and target thresholds directly to the map component
- Build a minimum viable enhancement to test the hypothesis in a controlled pilot
- Measure usage patterns, error rates and user satisfaction during the pilot
- Learn from the data and decide to pivot, persevere or scale
- Update the component’s position and annotations on the map accordingly

```
```yaml
hypothesis: Offering an online claim status form will reduce support calls by 20%
metric: support_calls_per_week
baseline: 150 calls
target: 120 calls within four weeks
experiment_owner: Digital Service Team
```
```

> Hypothesis testing ensures that refinements are driven by validated learning says a senior government strategist

To embed this practice organisationally, align Lean Startup experiments with agile ceremonies and OKRs. Use sprint retrospectives to review map annotations, governance checkpoints to validate data integrity and strategic reviews to prioritise the next set of hypotheses. This cultural integration ensures that every refinement is evidence‑led and contributes to the long‑term journey from product to utility.



#### <a id="agile-iterations-for-map-refinement"></a>Agile Iterations for Map Refinement

Agile iterations embed Wardley Map maintenance into regular cadences, ensuring that component positions reflect the latest user metrics and strategic shifts.

- Capture lessons on inertia removal and component drift velocity
- Identify patterns for upcoming sprints, such as components nearing commoditisation
- Align retrospective findings with the next sprint’s mapping backlog items

> Regular retrospectives not only refine features but sharpen strategic clarity on map evolution, says a senior government strategist



#### <a id="design-thinking-for-user-focus"></a>Design Thinking for User Focus

Design Thinking ensures that refinement in the Leverage phase remains grounded in genuine user needs and experiences. By embedding design thinking methods within Agile and Lean routines, teams maintain empathy, creativity and iterative validation as they move components towards commodity readiness.

- Empathy keeps focus on actual user behaviour and pain points
- Definition reframes metrics as human outcomes rather than raw data
- Ideation generates solution variants to address identified friction
- Prototyping tests improvements rapidly with minimal investment
- Testing gathers qualitative insights to complement quantitative metrics

Begin by applying the first two phases of Design Thinking in parallel with your analytics review. During **Empathise**, augment dashboard data with user interviews, frontline observations and service walk‑throughs. In **Define**, translate these findings into clear user problems that align with existing map components and annotations.

- **Empathise** Conduct user interviews and observational studies to uncover hidden needs
- **Define** Reframe metrics as human‑centred problem statements to guide refinement
- **Ideate** Generate multiple improvement concepts to reduce friction in high‑impact workflows
- **Prototype** Build lightweight mock‑ups or demos to test enhancements before full development
- **Test** Gather qualitative feedback from real users to validate prototypes and inform map updates

> By uniting design thinking with map updates teams avoid losing sight of user experience says a senior government strategist

Design Thinking techniques support updating the Wardley Map by surfacing qualitative insights that explain why certain components drift faster or face inertia. Capturing user stories and emotional journeys helps annotate dependencies with clarity on where to prioritise refinements.

- User journey maps to visualise all touchpoints and unveil hidden dependencies
- Empathy maps to record feelings, motivations and constraints alongside metrics
- Service blueprints to link front‑end experiences with back‑end operations
- Storyboards to illustrate future‑state journeys and guide evolution decisions
- Co‑creation workshops to involve users in rapid prototyping and map adjustments

> Regular design thinking sprints enrich map annotations with rich qualitative insights says a senior public sector practitioner



## <a id="commoditise-phase-industrialising-and-scaling-solutions"></a>Commoditise Phase: Industrialising and Scaling Solutions

### <a id="recognising-commodity-readiness"></a>Recognising Commodity Readiness

#### <a id="maturity-indicators"></a>Maturity Indicators

Maturity indicators provide objective signals that a component has reached the commodity stage and is ready for industrialisation. By tracking these indicators alongside the Wardley Map, teams can decide when to automate, standardise and scale services for maximum efficiency.

- Ubiquitous supply with multiple competing vendors
- Standardised interfaces and comprehensive documentation
- Economies of scale driving down cost per transaction
- High usage volumes with predictable performance
- Low customisation requests and clear configuration patterns
- Established SLAs, security certifications and compliance processes
- Automated provisioning, monitoring and self‑service portals

> Commodity services demonstrate stable behaviour and clear interfaces says a senior government official

```
```yaml
metrics:
  cost_per_transaction: < 0.05
  uptime: > 99.9%
  vendor_count: >= 3
  usage_volume: > 100000 transactions per day
  support_requests: < 1% of transactions
```
```

When these thresholds are consistently met and inertia blocks such as regulatory constraints or legacy dependencies are minimal, organisations should accelerate commoditisation efforts, shifting from bespoke or product mindsets to utility‑scale operations. Annotating these maturity indicators on the map creates a visual compass for leadership to time industrialisation activities.



#### <a id="assessing-market-demand"></a>Assessing Market Demand

Assessing market demand is a critical step in the commoditisation journey. By analysing real‑world uptake and stakeholder interest, public sector organisations ensure that industrialisation efforts focus on services with proven value and sustainable momentum. Demand assessment complements maturity indicators by verifying that capacity, cost models and governance frameworks can scale in line with user needs.

- User adoption rates and growth trends
- Procurement orders and contract renewals
- Enquiries and support ticket volumes
- Benchmarking against competitor offerings
- Feedback from frontline staff and citizens

Overlaying demand signals on your Wardley Map highlights timing for scaling activities. Components with sustained uptake and high enquiry volumes drift towards the Commodity zone more rapidly, signalling it is time to invest in automation, platform services and self‑service portals. Conversely, fluctuating demand or low procurement may indicate the need for further refinement or niche customisation.

```
```yaml
metrics:
  adoption_rate: > 75%
  procurement_volume: > 50 contracts per quarter
  service_requests: > 10000 per month
  stakeholder_satisfaction: > 80%
  integration_partners: >= 5
```
```

> Understanding demand signals guides strategic timing says a senior public sector strategist

By combining quantitative demand metrics with strategic mapping, organisations can time commoditisation to coincide with peak uptake and governance approval, unlocking cost efficiencies and ensuring reliable service levels at scale.



### <a id="best-practices-for-commoditisation"></a>Best Practices for Commoditisation

#### <a id="automating-and-standardising"></a>Automating and Standardising

In the commoditise phase, automation and standardisation are the twin engines that transform repeatable services into scalable utilities. By codifying processes, defining clear interfaces and automating delivery, public sector organisations can drive down costs, improve reliability and accelerate time to value.

- Codify repeatable patterns into shared modules and APIs
- Eliminate manual intervention via CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure as code
- Enforce compliance and governance through automated policy checks
- Provide self‑service portals to empower internal teams

Standardising interfaces and modules reduces technical debt and ensures interoperability across departments. A modular architecture with well‑defined APIs facilitates governance, version control and streamlined upgrades.

- Define semantic versioning strategies for APIs
- Maintain an API catalogue with clear documentation
- Use feature flags to manage rollout of standard modules
- Establish a configuration registry for local variants

Automation streamlines deployment, monitoring and incident response. Embracing platform engineering and infrastructure‑as‑code principles ensures consistency across environments and reduces lead time for provisioning services.

- Use Terraform or CloudFormation for infrastructure as code
- Implement CI/CD pipelines with automated testing and security scans
- Adopt observability tooling for real‑time metrics and alerting
- Integrate policy‑as‑code for compliance gating

```
```yaml
pipeline:
  stages:
    - name: build
      steps:
        - script: terraform init
        - script: terraform plan
    - name: deploy
      steps:
        - script: terraform apply -auto-approve
```
```

> Automating and standardising services unlock true utility scale benefits says a public sector technology leader

By combining these practices, organisations complete the ILC cycle, transitioning from bespoke products to cost‑efficient utilities and realising the full value of industrialised services.



#### <a id="building-platform-services"></a>Building Platform Services

Building platform services is the final step in the commoditisation phase, where mature components become shared utilities. A well‑engineered platform abstracts complexity, empowers teams with self‑service and delivers reliability at scale.

- Self‑service interfaces and developer portals
- Infrastructure as Code and automated provisioning
- Service catalogue with defined SLAs
- Telemetry, logging and observability baked into the platform
- Governance as code for security and compliance

Adopting a platform product mindset involves dedicated teams that treat the platform as a customer‑facing product. This ensures continuous improvement, clear roadmaps and measurable outcomes aligned with departmental needs and regulatory frameworks.

> Reusable platforms reduce cognitive load and accelerate delivery says a public sector technology leader

```
```yaml
pipeline:
  stages:
    - name: provision
      steps:
        - script: terraform init
        - script: terraform apply -auto-approve
    - name: deploy
      steps:
        - script: ./ci-run-tests.sh
```
```



### <a id="risk-governance-and-cost-optimisation"></a>Risk, Governance and Cost Optimisation

#### <a id="security-and-compliance"></a>Security and Compliance

In the commoditise phase, security and compliance shift from bespoke risk treatments to embedded utility services. As components mature into shared platforms, governance must be automated, consistent and auditable. Public sector organisations can no longer treat security as an afterthought; it must be codified and versioned alongside infrastructure and application artefacts.

Mapping security and compliance on your Wardley Map clarifies which controls remain custom‑built and which can be sourced as products or utilities. Early experiments in policy‑as‑code or sandboxed compliance checks belong to the Genesis zone, whereas mature logging, monitoring and identity services reside in the Commodity zone.

- Identity and Access Management automated through single sign‑on and role‑based controls
- Policy as Code embedded in CI/CD pipelines to enforce compliance gates
- Continuous Vulnerability Scanning with automated remediation workflows
- Centralised Audit Logging and Monitoring with real‑time alerting
- Incident Response orchestration via platform services and runbooks

By shifting security controls rightward on the evolution axis, organisations achieve repeatable patterns and drastic cost reductions. Commodity services for identity, encryption and threat intelligence allow teams to focus on higher‑value tasks such as tuning detection rules or refining risk models.

- Automate provisioning of security groups and network policies via infrastructure‑as‑code
- Integrate policy‑as‑code frameworks to validate configurations at build time
- Embed security scans and compliance checks in every pipeline stage
- Consolidate logs into a central SIEM with automated retention rules
- Use self‑service portals for audit evidence requests and certificate issuance

> Embedding security and compliance into platform services reduces friction and increases trust says a senior public sector strategist

Governance as code transforms policies, standards and risk controls into executable artefacts. By versioning these alongside application code, teams gain traceability. Auditable policy definitions replace manual checklists, enabling automated enforcement and real‑time compliance reporting.

```
```yaml
policy:
  name: enforce-encryption-at-rest
  description: ensure all storage volumes are encrypted
  version: 1.2.0
  rules:
    - resource: aws_ebs_volume
      attribute: encrypted
      condition: equals true
      remediation:
        action: aws ec2 modify-volume --volume-id ${volume_id} --encrypted
```
```

Integrating governance as code with platform engineering ensures that every environment—development, test and production—conforms to the same policies. When security controls drift or new regulations emerge, teams simply update the policy definitions and push through the pipeline.

- Maintain a central policy repository with semantic versioning
- Automate drift detection and remediation across all environments
- Provide self‑service compliance dashboards for teams and auditors
- Integrate real‑time alerts for failed policy checks into incident channels
- Review and update policies regularly based on threat intelligence and regulatory changes

Continuous improvement is the hallmark of a mature commoditisation approach. By treating security and compliance as industrialised services, public sector organisations can achieve predictable risk profiles, lower operational costs and faster audit cycles.



#### <a id="operational-cost-controls"></a>Operational Cost Controls

In the Commoditise phase, controlling operational costs is essential to sustain utility‑scale services and deliver value at the lowest possible price point. By aligning cost controls with your Wardley Map, teams can pinpoint mature components where automation, platform services and economies of scale drive down per‑unit spend without compromising reliability.

- Automate provisioning and scaling via infrastructure‑as‑code pipelines
- Embed cost governance in CI/CD through policy‑as‑code
- Implement internal chargeback or show‑back models
- Continuously monitor utilisation and performance metrics
- Negotiate vendor contracts and leverage multi‑supplier competition

Automating provisioning with tools such as Terraform or CloudFormation transforms manual tasks into repeatable code, delivering consistent environments and reducing staff overhead. Policy‑as‑code frameworks enforce governance gates at build time, preventing unapproved resource creation and curbing runaway spend.

```
```yaml
cost_controls:
  budget_alerts:
    daily_spend_limit: 5000
    component_thresholds:
      api_gateway: 0.02_per_request
      database: 0.01_per_query
  chargeback_model:
    departments:
      - name: Education
        share: 30%
      - name: Health
        share: 50%
      - name: Transport
        share: 20%
```
```

Internal chargeback models allocate expenses to consuming teams, creating transparency and incentivising cost‑efficient use of shared utilities. Regular reviews of utilisation dashboards highlight under‑used services and identify opportunities to reconfigure or decommission idle components.

> Embedding cost controls as code and visualising them on your map ensures financial discipline and drives continuous optimisation says a senior government strategist

#### <a id="mapping-a-saas-platform"></a>Mapping a SaaS Platform

Mapping a SaaS platform on a Wardley Map offers technology leaders a clear view of how user‑facing features, middleware services and underlying infrastructure evolve over time. By visualising dependencies and maturity stages, teams can align their Innovate, Leverage and Commoditise activities to optimise investment and speed to market.

- Identify core users (administrators, end users, third‑party integrators) and articulate their top‑level needs
- Build the value chain from the user interface down through API gateways, microservices, data stores and cloud infrastructure
- Position each component along the evolution axis (Genesis, Custom‑Built, Product, Commodity) based on novelty, standardisation and volume
- Annotate inertia blocks such as regulatory constraints, compliance checks or vendor lock‑in risks
- Iterate the map in Agile cadences, updating drift arrows to signal planned migrations from custom code to standard utilities

Once plotted, the SaaS map becomes a strategic playbook. Components in the Genesis and Custom‑Built zones highlight where to pilot new features or performance experiments. Product‑stage services reveal opportunities for standardisation and API packaging, while Commodity‑level infrastructure signals candidates for platform automation and cost optimisation.

### <a id="public-sector-transformation"></a>Public Sector Transformation

#### <a id="unique-challenges"></a>Unique Challenges

Public sector transformation often involves addressing distinct constraints and stakeholder dynamics that differ from commercial contexts. Applying Wardley Mapping and the ILC model in government requires sensitivity to budget cycles, regulatory mandates and the need for transparent decision‑making.

- Limited resources and rigid budgetary cycles constrain experimentation and piloting
- Frequent organisational restructuring and political changes disrupt continuity
- Bureaucratic resistance to new ways of working and perceived loss of authority
- Legacy systems with high technical debt slow component evolution and integration
- Skills shortages in digital literacy hinder rapid adoption of new tools and practices
- Complex socio‑political dynamics create divergent objectives across agencies
- Stringent data security and compliance requirements introduce inertia blocks

These challenges manifest as inertia blocks on a Wardley Map, delaying drift from genesis to utility. Mapping dependencies across multiple agencies uncovers single points of failure—such as an outdated database or a bespoke workflow—that must be innovated or commoditised in the right sequence.

> Mapping public sector landscapes reveals hidden constraints early and guides targeted interventions, says a senior government official

By combining ecosystem listening with iterative ILC cycles, public sector teams can pilot solutions in sandbox environments, gather empirical data and then scale effective services through commoditisation. This disciplined approach reduces risk and accelerates transformation under fiscal and regulatory scrutiny.



#### <a id="government-service-evolution"></a>Government Service Evolution

Government services are undergoing rapid transformation driven by digitalisation, cloud adoption and shifting citizen expectations. Within the ILC lifecycle and Wardley Mapping context, understanding this evolution is critical to identifying where to innovate, leverage and commoditise services at scale in the public sector.

- Cloud computing and platform‑first architectures reducing operational overhead
- GovTech initiatives modernising service delivery through citizen‑centric design
- DevOps and platform engineering practices accelerating release cycles
- Data‑driven policymaking powered by analytics and AI services
- Multi‑channel digital interfaces improving accessibility and inclusion
- Regulatory sandboxes enabling experimentation under controlled constraints

Plotting these drivers on a Wardley Map creates a visual landscape of dependencies and maturity. For example, digital identity may sit in the Product stage, while emerging analytics engines remain in Genesis. By aligning these to the Innovate, Leverage and Commoditise phases, teams can time interventions to reduce risk and maximise impact.

- Migrating from legacy databases to shared data platforms
- Navigating procurement regulations and multi‑supplier frameworks
- Aligning funding cycles with sprint‑based innovation
- Ensuring interoperability across departmental silos
- Securing data privacy and compliance at each stage
- Building digital literacy within front‑line teams

Addressing these challenges requires a disciplined ILC approach. Public sector teams should employ ecosystem listening to capture early signals, run user‑driven prototypes in sandbox environments and maintain living Wardley Maps to track drift and inertia.

### <a id="integrating-ilc-with-other-methodologies"></a>Integrating ILC with Other Methodologies

#### <a id="combining-ilc-and-agile"></a>Combining ILC and Agile

Integrating the Innovate‑Leverage‑Commoditise lifecycle with Agile methodologies ensures that mapping exercises and strategic playbooks remain grounded in iterative delivery and continuous feedback. Public sector teams can harmonise sprint cadences with ILC phases, embedding Wardley Map updates into Agile ceremonies to align innovation pilots, product refinements and utility‑scale rollouts with delivery cycles.

- Synchronise ILC phases with sprint boundaries, ensuring maps are reviewed at the start and end of each iteration
- Embed map annotations and drift arrows into backlog refinement, linking component maturity to user stories and epics
- Use Agile retrospectives to capture inertia blocks, emerging trends and validated hypotheses from the previous sprint
- Define ILC‑informed acceptance criteria to signal when a Genesis experiment graduates to Custom‑Built or Product form
- Maintain a living map in the team’s collaboration tool, versioned alongside code and documentation

By treating Wardley Mapping as a deliverable rather than a one‑off workshop, teams ensure that every sprint contributes to shifting components rightward on the evolution axis. Sprint goals become aligned to specific map movements: prototypes validated, product features standardised or automation pipelines established for utility services.

```
```yaml
user_story:
  as_a: policy_team_member
  i_want: to view component_maturity_on_map
  so_that: we can decide whether to innovate, refine or commoditise this capability
acceptance_criteria:
  - map_updated: true
  - component_annotation: includes_latest_metrics
  - drift_arrow: correctly reflects planned evolution
```
```

- Start each sprint planning with a map‑alignment session to connect backlog items to ILC zones
- Prioritise Genesis‑zone spikes and Custom‑Built refinements in the backlog grooming activity
- Use daily standups to call out map‑driven impediments or newly discovered dependencies
- Allocate time in sprint reviews for map version updates and annotation of outcomes
- Include a dedicated story for inertia removal or compliance gating when regulatory constraints are identified

In practice, a digital service team might run an Agile sprint to mature a Custom‑Built workflow engine. By linking each story to the corresponding map component, the team tracks how unit‑test success, user acceptance test results and performance metrics signal readiness to promote the engine into the Product zone.

> Aligning Wardley Map updates with sprint retrospectives creates a powerful feedback loop that sharpens both delivery and strategy says a senior government strategist

- Enhanced stakeholder visibility by aligning strategy maps with Agile artefacts
- Reduced strategic debt through early identification of inertia blocks in sprint reviews
- Faster learning cycles by coupling prototype validation with map‑driven drift decisions
- Clearer success criteria by mapping acceptance tests to evolution criteria
- Scalable outcomes through explicit stories for commoditisation activities

By weaving ILC thinking into Agile frameworks, public sector organisations transform strategic mapping from a standalone exercise into an embedded practice. This integration ensures that every sprint increment not only delivers features but also moves capabilities along the Innovate‑Leverage‑Commoditise lifecycle with clarity and purpose.



#### <a id="ilc-in-lean-startup"></a>ILC in Lean Startup

The Lean Startup methodology complements the ILC lifecycle by embedding **Build‑Measure‑Learn** loops into each phase. By treating MVPs as Genesis‑stage experiments, hypotheses become visible on a Wardley Map and drive data‑informed decisions for Innovate, Leverage and Commoditise activities.

- Align MVP development with the Innovate phase by plotting each hypothesis on the left of the evolution axis
- Conduct rapid Build‑Measure‑Learn cycles and annotate map components with validated learning
- Use Leverage phase metrics to refine product‑stage components and adjust drift arrows
- Automate and commoditise proven MVPs through platform engineering in the Commoditise phase

Integrating ILC with Lean Startup encourages a continuous feedback loop between strategic mapping and customer‑driven experiments. As each MVP is tested, its success metrics inform map updates, inertia block annotations and the timing of rightward shifts.

> Embedding MVP‑driven experiments into strategic mapping ensures that every iteration is grounded in real‑world demand says a senior innovation advisor

```
```yaml
mvp:
  hypothesis: Introducing a self‑service status dashboard reduces support tickets by 25%
  metric: support_tickets_per_week
  baseline: 200
  target: 150
  map_placement:
    component: status_dashboard
    stage: genesis
```
```



#### <a id="ilc-for-design-thinking"></a>ILC for Design Thinking

Integrating the Innovate‑Leverage‑Commoditise lifecycle with Design Thinking ensures that each phase remains deeply rooted in user empathy and iterative validation. By weaving human‑centred techniques into ILC, public sector teams can harness qualitative insights alongside quantitative metrics, enriching their Wardley Maps and guiding strategic shifts with a clear focus on real user needs.

- Empathy sustains focus on user pain points during Innovate
- Ideation aligns prototypes with validated hypotheses in Leverage
- Prototyping and testing accelerate commoditisation readiness
- Continuous feedback loops deepen map annotations with lived experience

Design Thinking introduces five key stages—Empathise, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test—that complement ILC by translating map components into human outcomes. In the Innovate phase, Empathise and Define guide the placement of genesis‑stage prototypes and the framing of hypothesis statements. During Leverage, Ideate and Prototype drive feature refinements, while Test generates the qualitative data that informs drift arrows and inertia blocks. Finally, in the Commoditise phase, validated solutions become self‑service utilities, supported by insights gathered through Test.

- Empathise: conduct user interviews and service walk‑throughs, annotate pain points on the map
- Define: translate qualitative insights into problem statements tied to specific map components
- Ideate: generate solution variants and link each concept to hypothesised drift arrows
- Prototype: build minimum viable enhancements and map evolution indicators
- Test: gather usability feedback and adjust component stages or inertia blocks accordingly

For example, a local authority implementing a digital benefits portal combined citizen empathy workshops with ILC mapping. By overlaying user journey maps onto their Wardley Map, they identified a custom‑built eligibility checker as a high‑value innovation candidate. Iterative prototypes refined the interface (Leverage) and testing outcomes triggered automation pipelines (Commoditise), resulting in a self‑service portal that reduced manual intervention by 60 percent.

```
mapDefinition:
  components:
    eligibility_checker:
      stage: custom-built
      hypothesis: intuitive interface reduces call centre volume by 30%
      metrics:
        - reduction_in_calls
      empathy_insights:
        - user_confusion_points
  drift_arrows:
    - eligibility_checker -> product
```
