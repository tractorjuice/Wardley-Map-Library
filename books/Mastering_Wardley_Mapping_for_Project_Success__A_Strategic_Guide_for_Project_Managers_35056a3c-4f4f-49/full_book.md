# Introduction: The Power of Wardley Mapping for Project Managers

## What is Wardley Mapping?

### Origins and key concepts

Wardley Mapping is a strategic planning technique developed by Simon Wardley in the early 2000s. It provides a visual representation of the components needed to serve user needs, their relationships, and their evolution over time. This powerful tool has gained significant traction in the business and technology sectors, and is increasingly being adopted by project managers to enhance their strategic decision-making capabilities.

The key concepts of Wardley Mapping revolve around four main elements:

- User Needs: The anchor and starting point of any Wardley Map, representing the ultimate goal or purpose of the system being mapped.
- Value Chain: The series of components that are required to meet the user needs, arranged vertically based on their visibility to the user.
- Evolution: The horizontal axis of the map, representing how components evolve from genesis (novel) to commodity (ubiquitous) over time.
- Movement: The dynamic nature of the map, showing how components shift along the evolution axis and how this impacts the entire system.

Wardley Mapping draws inspiration from various disciplines, including military strategy, lean manufacturing, and systems thinking. It combines these influences to create a unique approach that helps organisations understand their current position, anticipate future changes, and make informed strategic decisions.

A prominent technology executive once said, 'Wardley Mapping has revolutionised the way we think about strategy. It's like having a GPS for business decision-making.'

# Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Wardley Mapping for Project Managers

## Components of a Wardley Map

### Understanding the value chain

The value chain is a fundamental component of a Wardley Map and serves as the backbone for visualising how value flows through a project or organisation. For project managers, understanding the value chain is crucial for identifying key components, dependencies, and potential areas for improvement.

In the context of Wardley Mapping, the value chain represents the series of activities or components that contribute to delivering value to the end user. These components are arranged vertically on the map, with those closest to the user at the top and supporting components below.

- User needs: The topmost element of the value chain, representing the ultimate goal of the project or service
- Visible components: Elements that directly interact with or are visible to the user
- Supporting components: Underlying elements that enable the visible components to function
- Foundational components: Basic building blocks that support the entire system

Project managers can use the value chain in Wardley Mapping to gain insights into:

- Critical dependencies between components
- Potential bottlenecks or weak links in the project
- Opportunities for optimisation or outsourcing
- Areas where innovation or investment may yield the greatest returns

> A seasoned project manager once remarked, 'Understanding the value chain through Wardley Mapping has completely transformed how I approach project planning and resource allocation. It's like having a high-resolution X-ray of your project's anatomy.'

By mapping out the value chain, project managers can make more informed decisions about project priorities, resource allocation, and risk management. This visual representation also facilitates better communication with stakeholders, helping to align project goals with overall organisational strategy.

### Mapping evolution and movement

One of the key components that sets Wardley Maps apart from other strategic tools is the concept of evolution and movement. This dimension adds a crucial dynamic element to the map, allowing project managers to visualise how components change over time and anticipate future shifts in the project landscape.

Evolution in Wardley Mapping is represented on the horizontal axis of the map, typically divided into four stages:

- Genesis: Novel, uncertain, and rapidly changing components
- Custom-built: Emerging understanding, some standardisation
- Product: Well-understood, feature-differentiation focus
- Commodity: Highly standardised, utility-like services

As project managers, understanding the evolution of components is crucial for several reasons:

- Anticipating future changes in technology or processes
- Identifying potential areas for innovation or cost-saving
- Aligning project strategies with the maturity of components
- Making informed decisions about build vs. buy options

Movement in Wardley Maps refers to the natural progression of components from left to right on the evolution axis. This movement is driven by competition, user needs, and technological advancements. Project managers must be aware that this movement is often inevitable and can significantly impact project planning and execution.

> Understanding the evolution of components is like having a crystal ball for your project. It allows you to see where things are heading and adapt your strategy accordingly.

To effectively map evolution and movement, project managers should:

- Regularly assess the current evolutionary stage of each component
- Consider external factors that might accelerate or hinder evolution
- Plan for the impact of component evolution on project timelines and resources
- Use the map to communicate potential future states to stakeholders

By incorporating evolution and movement into their Wardley Maps, project managers gain a powerful tool for strategic foresight, enabling them to navigate the complex and ever-changing landscape of modern projects with greater confidence and agility.

### Anchoring the map with user needs

At the heart of every Wardley Map lies the user need, serving as the anchor and driving force behind the entire value chain. For project managers, understanding and accurately representing user needs is crucial for creating meaningful and effective maps.

User needs form the foundation of the map, positioned at the top of the value chain. They represent the ultimate purpose of the project or system being mapped. By starting with user needs, project managers ensure that every component and activity in the map is aligned with delivering value to the end user.

- Identify the primary users or stakeholders of the project
- Conduct user research to uncover genuine needs and pain points
- Articulate user needs clearly and concisely
- Prioritise user needs based on importance and impact

When anchoring the map with user needs, it's essential to distinguish between genuine needs and wants or solutions. Focus on the underlying problem or desire, rather than specific features or implementations. This approach allows for more flexibility and innovation in addressing user needs throughout the project lifecycle.

> A well-defined user need acts as a North Star for the entire project, guiding decision-making and ensuring that all efforts contribute to delivering real value.

Project managers should regularly revisit and validate user needs throughout the project, as they may evolve or change over time. This iterative process ensures that the map remains relevant and aligned with the project's ultimate goals.

# Chapter 4: Advanced Wardley Mapping Techniques for Project Managers

## Multi-Project and Programme Management

### Creating and managing portfolio maps

Portfolio maps are an advanced application of Wardley Mapping that allow project managers to visualise and manage multiple projects or programmes simultaneously. These maps provide a holistic view of an organisation's project landscape, enabling better strategic decision-making and resource allocation.

To create a portfolio map, project managers need to follow these key steps:

- Identify all relevant projects and programmes within the portfolio
- Map each project individually, focusing on key components and their evolutionary stages
- Combine individual project maps into a single, comprehensive portfolio map
- Identify common components, dependencies, and potential synergies across projects
- Highlight areas of overlap or conflict in resource allocation

Managing portfolio maps requires ongoing attention and regular updates. Project managers should:

- Regularly review and update the portfolio map as projects progress and evolve
- Use the map to facilitate discussions on resource allocation and prioritisation
- Identify opportunities for consolidation or standardisation across projects
- Monitor the overall strategic alignment of the portfolio with organisational goals
- Use the map to communicate portfolio status and strategy to stakeholders

> A seasoned project management consultant once remarked, 'Portfolio maps are like a strategic radar for organisations. They help you see the big picture and navigate through the complexity of multiple projects with clarity and purpose.'

By effectively creating and managing portfolio maps, project managers can gain a competitive advantage in multi-project environments. These maps enable better decision-making, improved resource utilisation, and a more strategic approach to project and programme management.

### Balancing resources across multiple projects

Wardley Mapping provides project managers with a powerful tool for balancing resources across multiple projects within a programme or portfolio. By visualising the value chains and evolution of components across different projects, managers can identify synergies, overlaps, and potential resource conflicts.

- Identify common components across projects
- Assess the evolutionary stage of shared resources
- Prioritise resource allocation based on strategic importance
- Optimise resource utilisation through cross-project coordination

One of the key benefits of using Wardley Maps for resource balancing is the ability to identify shared components across multiple projects. By mapping out the value chains of different projects side by side, project managers can quickly spot where resources are being duplicated or where there's potential for sharing.

> A seasoned project portfolio manager once remarked, 'Wardley Mapping revealed resource overlaps we hadn't noticed before, allowing us to consolidate efforts and significantly improve our overall efficiency.'

Another crucial aspect of resource balancing is understanding the evolutionary stage of shared components. This insight allows project managers to make informed decisions about where to invest resources for maximum impact. For instance, components in the genesis or custom-built stages may require more resources and attention than those in the product or commodity stages.

![Draft Wardley Map: [Insert Wardley Map: Balancing resources across multiple projects]](https://images.wardleymaps.ai/map_c7e236d9-b36a-42bf-96c9-1bef085fb13b.png)

> [View full Wardley Map report](markdown/wardley_map_reports/wardley_map_report_34_Balancing_resources_across_multiple_projects.md)

By leveraging Wardley Maps, project managers can also prioritise resource allocation based on strategic importance. Components that are higher up the value chain or those that are evolving rapidly may require more resources to maintain a competitive advantage. This strategic view enables managers to make tough decisions about resource allocation when conflicts arise between projects.

- Use maps to identify strategic components across projects
- Allocate more resources to high-value, rapidly evolving components
- De-prioritise or outsource commodity components to free up resources
- Regularly review and adjust resource allocation based on evolving maps

Finally, Wardley Mapping facilitates better cross-project coordination for optimal resource utilisation. By providing a common visual language, maps enable project managers, team leads, and executives to discuss resource allocation more effectively. This improved communication can lead to more efficient use of shared resources, reduced duplication of effort, and better alignment of projects with overall organisational strategy.

### Identifying synergies and conflicts between projects

When managing multiple projects or programmes, Wardley Mapping becomes an invaluable tool for identifying synergies and conflicts between different initiatives. By creating maps for each project and overlaying them, project managers can gain a holistic view of their portfolio and make informed decisions about resource allocation, timing, and strategic alignment.

- Create individual Wardley Maps for each project
- Overlay maps to identify common components and dependencies
- Analyse evolution stages of shared components across projects
- Identify potential resource conflicts and bottlenecks
- Spot opportunities for shared infrastructure or capabilities

When examining overlaid maps, project managers should look for components that appear in multiple projects. These shared components can represent either synergies or conflicts, depending on their nature and the projects' timelines.

![Draft Wardley Map: [Insert Wardley Map: Identifying synergies and conflicts between projects]](https://images.wardleymaps.ai/map_a83d68e9-b421-4e22-8f2b-54b1f6343034.png)

By addressing the identified bottlenecks, leveraging emerging technologies, and fostering a more integrated approach to cross-project collaboration, organizations can significantly improve their multi-project management capabilities. The evolution towards more data-driven, AI-enhanced project management will be crucial for maintaining competitive advantage in complex project environments.

> [View full Wardley Map report](markdown/wardley_map_reports/wardley_map_report_35_Identifying_synergies_and_conflicts_between_projec.md)

Synergies often emerge when projects share components in similar evolutionary stages. For example, if two projects require the development of a new API, combining these efforts can lead to cost savings and improved standardisation. Conflicts, on the other hand, may arise when multiple projects compete for the same limited resources or when they have conflicting goals for shared components.

> By using Wardley Maps to visualise our entire project portfolio, we were able to identify several opportunities for shared services that we hadn't previously considered. This not only reduced our overall costs but also improved consistency across our systems.

To effectively manage synergies and conflicts, project managers should consider the following strategies:

- Prioritise projects based on strategic importance and component evolution
- Create cross-project teams to manage shared components
- Develop a roadmap for evolving shared components to benefit multiple projects
- Implement a governance structure to manage conflicts and allocate resources
- Regularly review and update project maps to reflect changing landscapes

By leveraging Wardley Mapping in multi-project and programme management, organisations can optimise their project portfolios, reduce redundancies, and maximise the value delivered across all initiatives.
