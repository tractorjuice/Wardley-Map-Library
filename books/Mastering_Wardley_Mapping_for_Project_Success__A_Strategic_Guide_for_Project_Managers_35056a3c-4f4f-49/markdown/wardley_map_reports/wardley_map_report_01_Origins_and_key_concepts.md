- **Strategic Significance:** Fundamental driver of all other components, crucial for aligning strategy with actual user requirements.

### Value Chain

- **Position:** Upper middle (0.75, 0.70)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (based on position)
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for understanding how value is created and delivered to meet user needs.

### Evolution

- **Position:** Middle (0.60, 0.50)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Core concept in Wardley Mapping, essential for understanding component maturity and market dynamics.

### Movement

- **Position:** Lower middle (0.45, 0.30)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom Built
- **Strategic Significance:** Represents the dynamic nature of markets and technologies, crucial for anticipating changes.

### Strategic Planning

- **Position:** Lower right (0.30, 0.80)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom Built (evolving towards Product)
- **Strategic Significance:** Key application of Wardley Mapping, essential for informed decision-making and competitive positioning.

### Business Decision-Making

- **Position:** Bottom right (0.20, 0.90)
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis (evolving towards Custom Built)
- **Strategic Significance:** Ultimate goal of Wardley Mapping, representing the application of insights for competitive advantage.

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a clear progression from Genesis to Commodity along the evolution axis, with most key concepts positioned in the Custom Built to Product stages. This suggests that Wardley Mapping as a discipline is still evolving and maturing.
