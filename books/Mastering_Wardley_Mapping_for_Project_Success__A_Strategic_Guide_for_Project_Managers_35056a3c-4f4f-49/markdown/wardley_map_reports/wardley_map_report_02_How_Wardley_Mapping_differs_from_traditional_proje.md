## Map Overview

This map compares traditional project management approaches with Wardley Mapping, showing their relative positions in terms of evolution and value chain. It illustrates how these approaches contribute to project success and ultimately serve the customer.

**Anchor:** The anchor is 'Customer' at the top of the value chain. This signifies that all project management efforts ultimately aim to deliver value to the customer, emphasizing the customer-centric nature of both traditional and Wardley Mapping approaches.

## Component Analysis

### Traditional PM

- **Position:** Positioned higher on the value chain but lower on the evolution axis compared to Wardley Mapping
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Represents established methods that are well-understood but may be less adaptable to rapid change

### Wardley Mapping

- **Position:** Lower on the value chain but higher on the evolution axis compared to Traditional PM
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Represents a more evolved, strategic approach that provides deeper insights but may be less standardized

### Strategic Planning

- **Position:** Positioned between Traditional PM and Wardley Mapping, higher on the value chain
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Acts as a bridge between operational project management and strategic decision-making
