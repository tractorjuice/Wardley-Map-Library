## Map Overview

This map illustrates the components and relationships involved in using Wardley Mapping for project management, with a focus on anticipating and managing change.

**Anchor:** The anchor is the Project Manager, positioned at the top right of the map. This signifies that project management is the primary user need being addressed, and all other components support this function.

## Component Analysis

### Project Manager

- **Position:** Top right (0.95, 0.89)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+commodity)
- **Strategic Significance:** Central to the entire system, coordinating all other components

### Stakeholders

- **Position:** Upper right (0.85, 0.79)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for project success, requiring effective communication and management

### Wardley Mapping

- **Position:** Middle right (0.35, 0.84)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built to Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Key tool for strategic analysis and change anticipation

### Change Anticipation

- **Position:** Middle (0.45, 0.74)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built to Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Central to proactive project management and risk mitigation

### Disruptors

- **Position:** Bottom left (0.05, 0.44)
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis
- **Strategic Significance:** Potential source of significant change and risk, requiring constant monitoring

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a range of evolutionary stages, from genesis (Disruptors) to product/commodity (Project Manager). This indicates a mature project management framework incorporating emerging strategic tools and concepts.

### Key Evolving Components
- Change Anticipation
- Wardley Mapping
