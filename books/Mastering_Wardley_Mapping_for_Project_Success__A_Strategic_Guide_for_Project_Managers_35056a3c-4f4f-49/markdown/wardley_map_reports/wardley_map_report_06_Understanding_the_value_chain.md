## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the value chain of project management components, ranging from foundational elements to user needs, with a focus on project planning and organizational strategy.

**Anchor:** The anchor is 'User Needs', positioned at the top right. This signifies that all other components ultimately serve to fulfill these needs, emphasizing the user-centric approach in project management.

## Component Analysis

### User Needs

- **Position:** Top right (0.95, 0.95)
- **Evolution Stage:** Fully evolved
- **Strategic Significance:** Drives all other components and decisions in the project management ecosystem

### Organizational Strategy

- **Position:** Near top right (0.80, 0.90)
- **Evolution Stage:** Highly evolved
- **Strategic Significance:** Aligns project outcomes with broader organizational goals

### Visible Components

- **Position:** Upper middle (0.75, 0.80)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built to Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Represents the tangible outputs of project management that directly impact users

### Project Planning

- **Position:** Middle (0.65, 0.75)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+)
- **Strategic Significance:** Central to coordinating all project activities and resources

### Supporting Components

- **Position:** Lower middle (0.55, 0.60)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built to Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Provides necessary infrastructure for project execution

### Foundational Components

- **Position:** Lower left (0.35, 0.40)
- **Evolution Stage:** Commodity to Utility
- **Strategic Significance:** Forms the base upon which all other project components are built

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a clear evolution from foundational components through supporting and visible components to user needs, reflecting the maturity stages of project management elements.

### Key Evolving Components
- Project Planning
- Resource Allocation
- Risk Management

### Disruption Risks
