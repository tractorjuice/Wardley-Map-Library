- **Evolution Stage:** Evolving rapidly (indicated by 'evolve User Research 0.85')
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for understanding and validating user needs

### Stakeholder Identification

- **Position:** Positioned at [0.65, 0.8], slightly more visible than User Research
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom
- **Strategic Significance:** Important for ensuring all relevant perspectives are considered

### Need Articulation

- **Position:** Located at [0.55, 0.6], in the Product stage
- **Evolution Stage:** Evolving (indicated by 'evolve Need Articulation 0.65')
- **Strategic Significance:** Crucial for translating user needs into actionable project requirements

### Need Prioritization

- **Position:** Positioned at [0.45, 0.5], in the Product stage
- **Evolution Stage:** Evolving (indicated by 'evolve Need Prioritization 0.55')
- **Strategic Significance:** Essential for focusing resources on the most important user needs

### Project Alignment

- **Position:** Located at [0.35, 0.4], in the early Product stage
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for ensuring project goals match prioritized user needs

### Decision Making

- **Position:** Positioned at [0.25, 0.3], in the late Custom stage
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom
- **Strategic Significance:** Key for translating insights into actionable project decisions

### Value Delivery

- **Position:** Located at [0.15, 0.2], in the early Custom stage
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom
- **Strategic Significance:** Ultimate goal of the process, delivering value based on user needs

### Iterative Validation

- **Position:** Located at [0.40, 0.75], spanning multiple evolution stages
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom to Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Ensures continuous alignment with user needs throughout the process
