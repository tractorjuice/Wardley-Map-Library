## Map Overview

This map illustrates the integration of Wardley Mapping with Agile Scrum methodology, showing how these approaches can be combined for strategic project management.

**Anchor:** User Needs is the anchor, positioned at the top right. This signifies that understanding and meeting user needs is the primary driver and most visible aspect of the system, crucial for project success.

## Component Analysis

### Wardley Mapping

- **Position:** Middle-right, indicating it's a key strategic tool but not yet fully commoditized
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built moving towards product
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for informing strategic planning and build vs. buy decisions

### Agile Scrum Framework

- **Position:** Upper-middle, showing it's well-established but not fully commoditized
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Provides structure for project execution and team processes

### Strategic Planning

- **Position:** Middle-right, indicating its importance but not full maturity
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built moving towards product
- **Strategic Significance:** Bridges Wardley Mapping insights with project execution

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a system in transition, with Wardley Mapping and Build vs. Buy Decisions evolving rapidly. This indicates a shift towards more strategic, data-driven decision making in project management.

### Key Evolving Components
- Wardley Mapping
- Build vs. Buy Decisions

### Disruption Risks
- Custom Solutions
- Existing Products/Services

## Value Chain Analysis

Value flows from User Needs through strategic tools (Wardley Mapping, Agile Scrum) to inform planning and execution processes, ultimately resulting in project delivery.

### Critical Paths
- User Needs -> Wardley Mapping -> Strategic Planning -> Project Execution
- User Needs -> Agile Scrum Framework -> Sprint Goals -> Project Execution

### Bottlenecks
- Strategic Planning
- Build vs. Buy Decisions

## Strategic Positioning

The map shows a good balance between strategic planning (Wardley Mapping) and execution (Agile Scrum), with a clear focus on user needs. However, there's potential for better integration between these two methodologies.

### Misalignments
- Potential gap between Strategic Planning and Agile Scrum Framework
- Possible underutilization of Wardley Mapping in Sprint Planning

## Competitive Analysis
