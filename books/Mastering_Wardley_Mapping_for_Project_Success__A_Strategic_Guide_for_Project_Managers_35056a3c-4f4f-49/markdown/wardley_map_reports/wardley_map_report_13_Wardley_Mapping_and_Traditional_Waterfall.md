## Map Overview

This map illustrates the integration of Wardley Mapping with traditional waterfall project management, showing how Wardley Mapping can enhance various phases of a waterfall project lifecycle.

**Anchor:** The anchor is 'User Needs', positioned at the top right. This signifies that user needs are the driving force behind the project and are highly visible and evolved.

## Component Analysis

### Wardley Mapping

- **Position:** Low visibility, mid-evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Acts as a strategic tool influencing all project phases, potentially transforming traditional waterfall approaches.

### Traditional Waterfall

- **Position:** Low visibility, higher evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Represents the established project management methodology, but may be challenged by the integration of Wardley Mapping.

### Project Lifecycle Phases

- **Position:** Mid to low visibility, low evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis to Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Core components of project execution, potentially enhanced by Wardley Mapping integration.

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a transition from traditional waterfall methods towards more strategic, user-centric approaches through the integration of Wardley Mapping.
