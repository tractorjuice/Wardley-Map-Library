## Map Overview

This map illustrates an integrated approach to project management, combining Agile methodologies with Wardley Mapping. It shows how traditional project management evolves by incorporating these two frameworks to address the challenges of an evolving project landscape.

**Anchor:** The anchor is 'Project Management', positioned high on the value chain and towards the right of the evolution axis, indicating its maturity and essential role in delivering value to the organization.

## Component Analysis

### Project Management

- **Position:** High value chain (0.75), Product (0.89)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product/Commodity
- **Strategic Significance:** Core component that integrates Agile and Wardley Mapping approaches

### Agile Framework

- **Position:** High value chain (0.82), Product (0.78)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Provides iterative and flexible project execution methodology

### Wardley Mapping

- **Position:** Mid value chain (0.58), Custom-Built (0.72)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-Built (evolving to 0.68)
- **Strategic Significance:** Offers strategic insights and adaptability to project management

### Strategic Decision Making

- **Position:** Low value chain (0.54), Custom-Built (0.35)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-Built (evolving to 0.64)
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for aligning projects with organizational goals and market dynamics

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a mix of mature (Project Management, Agile Framework) and evolving (Wardley Mapping, Strategic Decision Making) components. This indicates a transition towards more adaptive and strategic project management approaches.

### Key Evolving Components
- Wardley Mapping
- Strategic Decision Making
- Project Adaptation

### Disruption Risks
