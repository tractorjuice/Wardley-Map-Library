## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the components and relationships involved in managing software development project pitfalls, with a focus on risk management and strategic planning tools.

**Anchor:** The anchor (user need) is 'Project Success', positioned at the top right of the map. This represents the ultimate goal of the system and drives the value of all other components.

## Component Analysis

### Project Success

- **Position:** High value, high certainty (0.95, 0.85)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** The ultimate goal, driving all other components. Its high position indicates it's well understood and crucial.

### Risk Management

- **Position:** High value, moderate certainty (0.75, 0.70)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for project success, but still evolving. The pipeline indicates ongoing refinement of risk management approaches.

### Wardley Mapping

- **Position:** Moderate value, moderate certainty (0.55, 0.60)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** An evolving tool for strategic analysis, crucial for identifying and managing various project components and risks.

### Traditional PM Tools

- **Position:** High value, moderate certainty (0.80, 0.65)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Well-established tools, but potentially less adaptive than newer approaches like Wardley Mapping.

### External Factors

- **Position:** Low value, low certainty (0.40, 0.30)
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis
- **Strategic Significance:** Unpredictable elements that can significantly impact project success, requiring constant monitoring.

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a mix of well-established components (Traditional PM Tools) and evolving ones (Wardley Mapping). The lower half of the map contains many genesis-stage components, indicating areas of uncertainty and potential for innovation.

### Key Evolving Components
- Wardley Mapping
- Regular Map Updates

### Disruption Risks
- Traditional PM Tools
