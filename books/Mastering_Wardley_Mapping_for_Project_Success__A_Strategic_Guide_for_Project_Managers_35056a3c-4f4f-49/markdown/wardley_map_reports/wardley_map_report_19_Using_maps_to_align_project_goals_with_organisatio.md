- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+commodity)
- **Strategic Significance:** Crucial in setting the direction for the entire organization and all projects

### Wardley Mapping

- **Position:** Mid-value, mid-certainty (0.50, 0.70)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built (evolving to product)
- **Strategic Significance:** Key tool for visualizing and analyzing the strategic landscape

### Project Components

- **Position:** Low value, low certainty (0.25, 0.25)
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis (evolving to custom-built)
- **Strategic Significance:** Represents the actual work being done in projects, critical for execution but highly variable
