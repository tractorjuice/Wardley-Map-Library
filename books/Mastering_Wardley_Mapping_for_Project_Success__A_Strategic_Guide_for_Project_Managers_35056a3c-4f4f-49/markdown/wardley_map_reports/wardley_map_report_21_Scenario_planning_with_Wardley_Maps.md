## Map Overview

This map illustrates the process and components involved in scenario planning using Wardley Maps. It shows how organizations can develop adaptive strategies by considering future scenarios, uncertainties, and strategic options.

**Anchor:** The anchor appears to be 'Project Landscape', representing the overall context in which scenario planning takes place. Its significance lies in grounding the entire process in the current reality of the project or organization.

## Component Analysis

### Project Landscape

- **Position:** Custom-built (0.65, 0.70)
- **Evolution Stage:** Late Product (+Rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Serves as the foundation for scenario planning, incorporating market realities and organizational goals.

### Key Uncertainties

- **Position:** Genesis (0.30, 0.80)
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for identifying potential disruptors and shaping future scenarios.

### Future Scenarios

- **Position:** Concept (0.40, 0.75)
- **Evolution Stage:** Early Concept
- **Strategic Significance:** Central to the scenario planning process, informing risk assessment and opportunity identification.

### Adaptive Strategy

- **Position:** Custom-built (0.50, 0.60)
- **Evolution Stage:** Early Product
- **Strategic Significance:** The ultimate goal of the scenario planning process, incorporating insights from various components.

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a progression from genesis-stage components (Key Uncertainties, Potential Disruptors) through concept and custom-built stages to more evolved components like Market Realities. This reflects the process of transforming uncertain factors into concrete strategies.

### Key Evolving Components
- Future Scenarios
- Strategic Options
- Adaptive Strategy

### Disruption Risks
- Baseline Strategy
- Project Landscape

## Value Chain Analysis

Value flows from Market Realities and Organizational Goals through the Project Landscape, informing the development of scenarios and strategic options, ultimately culminating in an Adaptive Strategy.

### Critical Paths
- Key Uncertainties -> Future Scenarios -> Risk Assessment/Opportunity Identification -> Strategic Options -> Adaptive Strategy

### Bottlenecks
- Future Scenarios development
- Strategic Options evaluation

## Strategic Positioning

The map positions scenario planning as a bridge between current realities (Project Landscape, Market Realities) and future possibilities (Future Scenarios, Strategic Options). This positioning enables organizations to develop adaptive strategies that are both grounded in reality and prepared for potential futures.

### Misalignments
- Potential gap between Baseline Strategy and Adaptive Strategy
- Possible disconnect between Key Uncertainties and Market Realities
