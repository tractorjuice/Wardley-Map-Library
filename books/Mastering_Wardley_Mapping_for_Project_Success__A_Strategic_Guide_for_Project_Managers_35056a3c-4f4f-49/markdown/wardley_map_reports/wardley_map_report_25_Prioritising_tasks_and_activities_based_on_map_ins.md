## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the components and relationships involved in task prioritisation for project success, with a focus on using Wardley Mapping as a strategic tool.

**Anchor:** The anchor is Customer Value, positioned at the top right of the map. This signifies that all activities and components ultimately aim to deliver value to the customer, which is critical for project success.

## Component Analysis

### Customer Value

- **Position:** Top right (0.95, 0.85)
- **Evolution Stage:** Fully evolved
- **Strategic Significance:** Ultimate goal of all project activities, driving project success and strategic decisions

### Project Success

- **Position:** High visibility (0.90, 0.75)
- **Evolution Stage:** Highly evolved
- **Strategic Significance:** Key outcome measure, directly linked to customer value and dependent on effective task prioritisation

### Task Prioritisation

- **Position:** Mid-range (0.70, 0.65)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Central to project execution, influenced by multiple factors and directly impacting project success

### Wardley Mapping

- **Position:** Lower mid-range (0.55, 0.55)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Key strategic tool for understanding component relationships and evolution, informing task prioritisation

### Custom-Built Components

- **Position:** Lower left (0.30, 0.40)
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis/Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Represents areas of potential innovation and differentiation, requiring careful resource allocation

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a range of evolutionary stages, from genesis (custom-built components) to commodity (market conditions). This diversity indicates a complex project environment requiring nuanced management approaches.

### Key Evolving Components
- Custom-Built Components
- Product Components

### Disruption Risks
- Custom-Built Components
- Wardley Mapping

## Value Chain Analysis

Value flows from the bottom-left (custom-built and product components) through various analytical and strategic tools (Wardley Mapping, Critical Path Analysis, etc.) to Task Prioritisation, ultimately contributing to Project Success and Customer Value.

### Critical Paths
- Custom-Built Components -> Wardley Mapping -> Task Prioritisation -> Project Success

### Bottlenecks
- Task Prioritisation
- Wardley Mapping

## Strategic Positioning

The map shows a strong focus on strategic tools and methodologies positioned in the custom-built to product stages, indicating a sophisticated approach to project management. However, there's a potential over-reliance on custom solutions which may impact efficiency.

### Misalignments
