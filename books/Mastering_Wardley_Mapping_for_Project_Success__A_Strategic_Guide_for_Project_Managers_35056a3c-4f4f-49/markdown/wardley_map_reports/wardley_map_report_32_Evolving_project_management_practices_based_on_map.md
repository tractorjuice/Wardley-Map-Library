## Map Overview

This map illustrates the evolution of project management practices through the integration of Wardley Mapping, focusing on continuous improvement and learning.

**Anchor:** Project Delivery is the anchor, representing the ultimate user need. Its high visibility and low evolution indicate it's a well-understood but critical component that drives all other activities.

## Component Analysis

### Wardley Mapping

- **Position:** Custom-built (0.55, 0.85)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Key enabler for project management evolution, driving insights and improvements

### Continuous Improvement

- **Position:** Custom-built (0.65, 0.75)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Central to evolving project management practices, linking insights to action

### Traditional PM Tools

- **Position:** Product (0.85, 0.70)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Established foundation, but potentially limiting compared to newer approaches

### Methodology Adaptation

- **Position:** Genesis (0.40, 0.10)
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for long-term evolution and effectiveness of project management practices

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a transition from traditional project management towards more adaptive, insight-driven practices. Wardley Mapping and Continuous Improvement are evolving rapidly, while Traditional PM Tools are more stable but also at risk of becoming outdated.
