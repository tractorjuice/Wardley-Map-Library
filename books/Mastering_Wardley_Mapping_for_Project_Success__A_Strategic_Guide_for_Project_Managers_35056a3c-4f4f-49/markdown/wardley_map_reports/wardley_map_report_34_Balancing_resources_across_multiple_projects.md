## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the components and relationships involved in managing resources across multiple projects within an organization. It spans from high-level strategic elements to specific project management tools and techniques.

**Anchor:** The anchor of this map is Project Management, positioned at [0.85, 0.95]. This represents the core user need of effectively managing multiple projects and their resources, which drives the entire system depicted in the map.

## Component Analysis

### Project Management

- **Position:** Positioned at [0.85, 0.95], indicating it's a highly visible and mature practice
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Central to the entire system, serving as the primary interface for managing multiple projects

### Resource Allocation

- **Position:** Located at [0.75, 0.85], showing it's a well-understood but still evolving practice
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for optimizing the use of resources across projects and ensuring efficiency

### Cross-Project Coordination

- **Position:** At [0.65, 0.80], indicating it's less evolved than Project Management but still fairly mature
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Essential for ensuring alignment and avoiding conflicts between multiple projects

### Strategic Prioritization

- **Position:** Positioned at [0.55, 0.90], showing high visibility but less evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Crucial for aligning projects with organizational goals and maximizing overall value

### Shared Components

- **Position:** At [0.50, 0.70], representing a mid-stage of evolution and visibility
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built to Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Key for efficiency and consistency across projects, but requires careful management

### Wardley Mapping

- **Position:** Located at [0.40, 0.50], indicating it's still an emerging practice
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Provides strategic insights for resource allocation and project prioritization

## Evolution Analysis
