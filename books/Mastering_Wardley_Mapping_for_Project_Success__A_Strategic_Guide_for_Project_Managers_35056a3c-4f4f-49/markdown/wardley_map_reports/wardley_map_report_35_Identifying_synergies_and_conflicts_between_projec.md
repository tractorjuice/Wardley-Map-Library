## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the components and relationships involved in managing multiple projects within a portfolio, focusing on identifying synergies and conflicts between projects.

**Anchor:** The anchor is Project Management, positioned at [0.8, 0.9]. This represents the core need for coordinating and overseeing multiple projects, serving as the starting point for the value chain.

## Component Analysis

### Project Management

- **Position:** High visibility (0.9) and high evolution (0.8)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+commodity)
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for overall portfolio success, highly visible but approaching commodity status

### Individual Project Maps

- **Position:** High visibility (0.8) and moderate evolution (0.6)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Essential for understanding each project, but not yet fully commoditized

### Overlaid Maps

- **Position:** Moderate visibility (0.7) and low-moderate evolution (0.4)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Key for identifying inter-project relationships, with significant room for evolution and improvement

### Shared Components

- **Position:** Moderate visibility (0.6) and moderate evolution (0.5)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for efficiency and synergy, positioned to evolve further

### Resource Allocation

- **Position:** Moderate visibility (0.5) and high evolution (0.7)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+commodity)
- **Strategic Significance:** Essential for portfolio optimization, approaching commodity status

### Strategic Alignment

- **Position:** Low-moderate visibility (0.4) and moderate evolution (0.6)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Crucial for ensuring projects contribute to overall strategy, with room for further evolution

### Cross-Project Teams

- **Position:** Low visibility (0.3) and moderate evolution (0.5)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built (+product)
- **Strategic Significance:** Important for fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing, transitioning from custom to product

### Governance Structure

- **Position:** Low visibility (0.2) and high evolution (0.7)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+commodity)
- **Strategic Significance:** Essential for maintaining control and consistency across projects, highly evolved

### Shared Infrastructure

- **Position:** Low visibility (0.1) and moderate evolution (0.6)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Foundational for efficient multi-project management, well-evolved but not yet commoditized

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a range of evolutionary stages, with most components in the product or transitioning to product stage. This indicates a maturing multi-project management approach with opportunities for further optimization.

### Key Evolving Components
- Overlaid Maps
- Shared Components

### Disruption Risks
- Individual Project Maps
- Cross-Project Teams

## Value Chain Analysis

Value flows from Project Management through Individual Project Maps to Overlaid Maps, then to Shared Components, which feed into both Synergies and Conflicts. These inform Resource Allocation, which drives Strategic Alignment, Cross-Project Teams, Governance Structure, and ultimately Shared Infrastructure.

### Critical Paths
- Project Management -> Individual Project Maps -> Overlaid Maps -> Shared Components
- Shared Components -> Resource Allocation -> Strategic Alignment

### Bottlenecks
- Overlaid Maps
- Shared Components

## Strategic Positioning

The positioning shows a logical progression from high-visibility, evolved components (like Project Management) to lower-visibility, foundational elements (like Shared Infrastructure). This structure supports effective multi-project management while highlighting areas for potential improvement.

### Misalignments
- Overlaid Maps (could be more evolved)
- Cross-Project Teams (could be more visible)
