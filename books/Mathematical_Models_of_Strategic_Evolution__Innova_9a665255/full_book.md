## Integrated Strategic Evolution Models

### System Dynamics

#### Feedback Loop Analysis

Feedback loops play a crucial role in understanding how strategic decisions influence system behavior over time within the Innovate, Leverage, Commoditise (ILC) framework. These loops can either reinforce or balance strategic outcomes, creating complex dynamics that require sophisticated mathematical modeling.
