## Map Overview

A comprehensive healthcare LLM implementation map showing the relationship between proprietary and open-source models within a healthcare context

**Anchor:** Healthcare Organisation and Clinical Outcomes serve as the primary anchors, representing the ultimate value delivery to patients and healthcare providers

## Component Analysis

### Healthcare Organisation

- **Position:** High visibility, high maturity (0.95, 0.79)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product/Commodity
- **Strategic Significance:** Core anchor driving all downstream requirements and value creation

### Proprietary LLMs

- **Position:** Mid visibility, mid maturity (0.45, 0.52)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom/Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical decision point for implementation strategy, marked with inertia

### Open Source LLMs

- **Position:** Lower visibility, lower maturity (0.35, 0.48)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom
- **Strategic Significance:** Alternative approach offering flexibility but requiring more technical expertise
