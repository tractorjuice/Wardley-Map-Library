## Map Overview

A comprehensive map depicting the compliance and trust framework required for implementing Meta's closed-source LLMs in healthcare settings under GDPR regulations

**Anchor:** Patient Trust is the primary anchor, positioned at high visibility and high evolution, indicating its fundamental importance to the healthcare service delivery system

## Component Analysis

### Patient Trust

- **Position:** 0.85, 0.95 - Highly visible and evolved
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+utility)
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical foundation for healthcare service delivery and GDPR compliance

### Meta's LLM

- **Position:** 0.55, 0.75 - Mid visibility and evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Core technology requiring significant compliance adaptation

### Data Protection Framework

- **Position:** 0.70, 0.70 - High visibility, moderate evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Product with inertia
- **Strategic Significance:** Essential infrastructure for compliance and risk management

## Evolution Analysis
