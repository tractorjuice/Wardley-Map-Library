## Map Overview

A comprehensive map depicting the validation process for implementing closed-source LLMs in clinical settings, with components ranging from patient safety to technical implementation

**Anchor:** Patient Safety serves as the anchor, positioned at the highest visibility and value, reflecting healthcare's primary obligation to protect patients

## Component Analysis

### Patient Safety

- **Position:** 0.95, 0.89 - Highest visibility and value
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+utility)
- **Strategic Significance:** Core driver of all validation requirements and decisions

### Closed-source LLM

- **Position:** 0.25, 0.25 - Genesis/Custom built
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis
- **Strategic Significance:** Foundation technology with high inertia, indicating significant implementation challenges

### Validation Framework

- **Position:** 0.65, 0.75 - Product
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical orchestrating component connecting regulatory requirements to implementation

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a system in transition from custom-built solutions to more standardized products

### Key Evolving Components
- Clinical Testing (explicitly marked for evolution to 0.55)
- Real-world Monitoring (evolving to 0.45)
- Performance Metrics (evolving to 0.65)

### Disruption Risks
- Closed-source LLM (due to rapid AI advancement)
- Edge Case Testing (may require continuous adaptation)
- Bias Detection (emerging field with rapid changes)

## Value Chain Analysis
