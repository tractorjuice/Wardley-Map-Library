## Map Overview

A comprehensive map showing the implementation challenges of integrating Meta's LLMs into healthcare institutions, spanning from core infrastructure to emerging capabilities

**Anchor:** Healthcare Institution serves as the anchor, representing the primary user need for implementing LLM technology in healthcare delivery

## Component Analysis

### Meta LLM

- **Position:** Mid-chain position (0.65, 0.72)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+Custom)
- **Strategic Significance:** Core technology component that drives value creation but requires significant customization and integration

### Clinical Staff

- **Position:** High visibility (0.82, 0.78)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (with inertia)
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical human component with high inertia, requiring careful change management

### Model Customization

- **Position:** Genesis (0.15, 0.15)
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis/Custom
- **Strategic Significance:** Key differentiator for successful implementation, currently highly uncertain
