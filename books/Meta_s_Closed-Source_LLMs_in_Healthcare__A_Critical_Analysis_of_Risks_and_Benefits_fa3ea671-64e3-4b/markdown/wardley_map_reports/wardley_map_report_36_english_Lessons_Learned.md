## Map Overview

A comprehensive map showing the implementation journey of Meta's LLMs in healthcare settings, from foundational strategy to patient care delivery

**Anchor:** Patient Care is the anchor, positioned at high visibility and high evolution, indicating it's the primary value driver and a well-understood need in the healthcare system

## Component Analysis

### Patient Care

- **Position:** 0.95, 0.89 - Highly visible and evolved
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+commodity)
- **Strategic Significance:** Ultimate value delivery point and primary success metric for the system

### Meta's LLM

- **Position:** 0.65, 0.75 - Mid-high visibility and evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (moving towards commodity)
- **Strategic Significance:** Core technology enabler with rapid evolution potential

### Data Governance

- **Position:** 0.45, 0.55 - Mid visibility and evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built (with inertia)
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical foundation for reliable and compliant LLM implementation
