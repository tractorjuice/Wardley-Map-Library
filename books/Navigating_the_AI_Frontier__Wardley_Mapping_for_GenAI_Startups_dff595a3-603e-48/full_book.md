As we delve into the origins and principles of Wardley Mapping, it becomes clear why this approach is particularly relevant for GenAI startups navigating the complex and rapidly evolving artificial intelligence landscape.

The genesis of Wardley Mapping can be traced back to the early 2000s when Wardley, then a CEO grappling with strategic decisions, realised the limitations of existing strategic frameworks. He sought a method that could visually represent the components of a business or technology ecosystem, their relationships, and their evolution over time. This led to the development of Wardley Maps, which are essentially value chain maps set against an evolution axis.

Wardley Mapping filled a crucial gap in strategic thinking by providing a visual, dynamic representation of business landscapes. It's not just a tool, but a new language for strategy that is particularly suited to the fast-paced world of technology and innovation.

The fundamental principles of Wardley Mapping are rooted in several key concepts that make it uniquely suited for strategic planning in dynamic environments like the GenAI sector:

- Visibility of components: Mapping out all the components that make up a business or technology ecosystem, from user needs to the underlying infrastructure.
- Positioning on the value chain: Arranging these components based on their value to the end user, from the most visible (user needs) to the most invisible (underlying technologies).
- Evolution axis: Plotting components along an axis that represents their evolutionary stage, from genesis (novel and poorly understood) to commodity (well-understood and easily replicable).
- Movement and dynamics: Recognising that components naturally evolve over time, moving from left to right on the map as they become more commoditised.
- Dependencies and connections: Identifying and visualising the relationships and dependencies between different components.
- Anchoring: Using well-known, stable components as reference points to position other, less certain elements.
- Patterns of change: Recognising common patterns in how landscapes evolve and how successful strategies can be applied.

These principles combine to create a powerful framework for understanding and navigating complex business environments. For GenAI startups, Wardley Mapping offers a unique lens through which to view the AI landscape, identify opportunities, and craft robust strategies.

One of the key strengths of Wardley Mapping is its ability to reveal hidden assumptions and dependencies. In the rapidly evolving field of GenAI, where new technologies and use cases are constantly emerging, this visibility is crucial. It allows startups to anticipate changes, identify potential bottlenecks, and make informed decisions about where to focus their resources.

Wardley Mapping is not just about creating a static picture of your business landscape. It's about understanding the forces of change and using that understanding to navigate towards your desired future. For GenAI startups, this dynamic perspective is invaluable in a field where the pace of innovation is relentless.

Moreover, the evolutionary aspect of Wardley Mapping aligns particularly well with the nature of AI technologies.

### <a id="balancing-build-vs-buy-decisions"></a>Balancing Build vs. Buy Decisions

In the rapidly evolving landscape of Generative AI, startups face a critical decision when mapping their technical stack: whether to build custom solutions or leverage existing technologies. This build vs. buy dilemma is particularly crucial for GenAI startups, as it can significantly impact their agility, resource allocation, and competitive advantage. Wardley Mapping provides an invaluable framework for navigating this complex decision-making process, allowing startups to visualise their technical components and make informed strategic choices.

To effectively balance build vs. buy decisions, startups must first map their technical stack using Wardley Mapping principles. This involves identifying all the components of their GenAI service, from foundational infrastructure to user-facing applications, and positioning them on the evolution axis. By doing so, startups can gain a clear understanding of which components are commoditised and which are still in the genesis or custom-built stages.

- Identify all technical components of your GenAI service
- Position each component on the evolution axis
- Assess the strategic importance of each component
- Evaluate the availability and maturity of off-the-shelf solutions
- Consider the long-term implications of build vs. buy for each component

Once the technical stack is mapped, startups can begin to assess which components are candidates for building in-house and which are better suited for procurement. Components in the genesis or custom-built stages that are core to the startup's value proposition are often strong candidates for in-house development. These might include proprietary AI models, unique data processing pipelines, or novel user interfaces that differentiate the service in the market.

> In my experience advising GenAI startups, I've observed that those who successfully balance build vs. buy decisions are able to focus their limited resources on developing truly innovative components while leveraging existing solutions for more commoditised aspects of their stack.

Conversely, components that are further along the evolution axis and approaching commodity status are typically better suited for procurement. These might include cloud infrastructure, standard databases, or well-established AI frameworks. By purchasing these components, startups can benefit from the economies of scale and reliability offered by established providers, allowing them to focus their resources on core differentiators.

However, the decision is not always straightforward. Startups must also consider factors such as cost, scalability, integration complexity, and vendor lock-in. Wardley Mapping can help visualise these considerations by incorporating additional layers of information onto the map, such as cost structures or strategic importance.

- Cost analysis: Compare long-term costs of building vs. buying
- Scalability assessment: Evaluate the ability to scale both built and bought solutions
