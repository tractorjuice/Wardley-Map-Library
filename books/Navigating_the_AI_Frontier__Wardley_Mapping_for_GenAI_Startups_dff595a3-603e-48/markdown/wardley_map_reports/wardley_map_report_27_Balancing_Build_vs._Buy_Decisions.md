## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the technical stack of a GenAI startup, focusing on the build vs. buy decision points for various components. It spans from foundational infrastructure to customer-facing elements, highlighting the interplay between commodity and custom components.

**Anchor:** The anchor is 'GenAI Customers' positioned at [0.90, 0.95], signifying the ultimate value creation point and driving force for all other components in the map.

## Component Analysis

### Cloud Infrastructure

- **Position:** [0.85, 0.20] - Highly visible, commodity
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical foundation but low differentiation; prime candidate for 'buy' decision

### Proprietary AI Models

- **Position:** [0.30, 0.80] - Less visible, custom
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built to Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Core differentiator; strong 'build' candidate to maintain competitive edge

### Data Processing Pipeline

- **Position:** [0.45, 0.60] - Moderate visibility, semi-custom
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built to Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Important for efficiency and scalability; potential for hybrid build/buy approach

### User Interface

- **Position:** [0.40, 0.70] - High visibility, semi-custom
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built to Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for user experience; likely requires custom development with potential for component reuse
