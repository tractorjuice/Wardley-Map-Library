## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the structure and components of collaborative mapping sessions, focusing on fostering strategic thinking and innovation in the context of GenAI startups.

**Anchor:** The anchor is 'Collaborative Mapping Session Structure', positioned at [0.50, 0.95]. This represents the core user need for organized, effective strategic sessions in GenAI startups.

## Component Analysis

### Facilitator

- **Position:** High value, high evolution [0.75, 0.85]
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+commodity)
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for guiding sessions and ensuring productive outcomes

### Strategic Culture

- **Position:** High value, low evolution [0.15, 0.80]
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis
- **Strategic Significance:** Foundational for long-term success, but currently underdeveloped

### GenAI Landscape

- **Position:** Low value, low evolution [0.20, 0.15]
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis
- **Strategic Significance:** Represents the rapidly evolving field that the startup operates in, crucial for context

### Digital Collaboration Tools

- **Position:** High value, medium evolution [0.85, 0.55]
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Enables remote participation and efficient collaboration

## Evolution Analysis
