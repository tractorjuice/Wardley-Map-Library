- **Evolution Stage:** Fully evolved
- **Strategic Significance:** Central to the entire system, representing the end-user whose needs drive all other components.

### Forest

- **Position:** High value, moderate visibility (0.85, 0.65)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Represents the environment or context in which navigation occurs, crucial for understanding the challenges faced.

### Navigation Methods

- **Position:** Moderate value, low visibility (0.55, 0.45)
