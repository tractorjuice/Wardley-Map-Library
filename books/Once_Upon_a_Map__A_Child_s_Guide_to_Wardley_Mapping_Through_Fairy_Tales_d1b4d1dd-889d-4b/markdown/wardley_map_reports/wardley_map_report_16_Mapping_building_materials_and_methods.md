## Map Overview

This Wardley Map depicts the building materials and construction methods used by the Three Little Pigs, illustrating the evolution of construction techniques from basic to advanced.

**Anchor:** The anchor (user need) is not explicitly shown, but can be inferred as 'House Construction' or 'Protection from the Wolf'. This anchor drives the need for the various building materials and methods.

## Component Analysis

### Straw

- **Position:** Low value chain, high evolution (0.15, 0.7)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Easily accessible but least durable option, representing basic construction material

### Sticks

- **Position:** Mid value chain, mid-high evolution (0.35, 0.6)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Moderate durability and accessibility, representing an intermediate construction material

### Bricks

- **Position:** High value chain, mid evolution (0.75, 0.5)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Most durable option, representing advanced construction material with higher value

### Stacking

- **Position:** Low value chain, low evolution (0.2, 0.4)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Basic construction method, easy to implement but least effective

### Tying

- **Position:** Mid value chain, low evolution (0.4, 0.3)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Intermediate construction method, more effective than stacking but still relatively basic

### Masonry

- **Position:** High value chain, low evolution (0.8, 0.2)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Advanced construction method, most effective but requires more skill and resources

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a clear progression from basic to advanced materials and methods. Materials are more evolved than their corresponding construction methods, indicating a potential for method improvement.

### Key Evolving Components
