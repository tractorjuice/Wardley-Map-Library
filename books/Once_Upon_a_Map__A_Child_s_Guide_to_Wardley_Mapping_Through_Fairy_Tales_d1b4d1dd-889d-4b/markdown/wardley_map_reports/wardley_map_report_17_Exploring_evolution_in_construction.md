## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the evolution of construction techniques and materials through the lens of the Three Little Pigs' story, showcasing the progression from basic to advanced building strategies.

**Anchor:** The anchor (user need) in this map is Security, positioned at [0.8, 0.1]. It represents the ultimate goal of the construction efforts - to create a safe and secure dwelling. Its high visibility and low evolution position indicate it's a well-understood, essential need driving all other components.

## Component Analysis

### Straw House

- **Position:** [0.1, 0.7] - Low evolution, moderate visibility
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis
- **Strategic Significance:** Represents the most basic construction approach. Its low evolution suggests it's outdated and vulnerable, but its moderate visibility indicates it's still recognized as a construction method.

### Stick House

- **Position:** [0.3, 0.5] - Low-to-mid evolution, mid visibility
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** An improvement over the Straw House, representing a step forward in construction techniques. Its position suggests it's more established but still not optimal.

### Brick House

- **Position:** [0.6, 0.3] - Mid-to-high evolution, lower visibility
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** The most advanced construction method shown. Its high evolution and lower visibility suggest it's a more sophisticated, standardized approach that's becoming the norm.

### Building Materials

- **Position:** [0.5, 0.8] - Mid evolution, high visibility
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built to Product
- **Strategic Significance:** A critical component that directly influences the quality and durability of construction. Its high visibility underscores its importance in the value chain.

### Construction Techniques

- **Position:** [0.4, 0.6] - Mid evolution, mid-high visibility
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Represents the methods used to assemble materials. Its position suggests room for further evolution and standardization.
