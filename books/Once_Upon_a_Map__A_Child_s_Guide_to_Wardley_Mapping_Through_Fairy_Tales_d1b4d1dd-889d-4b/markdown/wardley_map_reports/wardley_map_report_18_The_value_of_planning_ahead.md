## Map Overview

This map represents the building materials and planning process for the Three Little Pigs' houses, illustrating the value of planning ahead in construction.

**Anchor:** House Protection is the anchor, representing the ultimate user need for safety and shelter. Its high visibility and high value position underscores its critical importance to the pigs.

## Component Analysis

### House Protection

- **Position:** Visible (0.95) and Custom-built (0.85)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Core user need, driving all other components. Its high position indicates it's a well-understood, essential requirement.

### Brick

- **Position:** Visible (0.75) and Product (0.60)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Most evolved building material, offering best protection. Its position suggests it's a key differentiator in house construction.

### Sticks

- **Position:** Concept (0.35) and Genesis (0.40)
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis, evolving towards Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Intermediate solution, balancing ease of acquisition with moderate protection. Its evolution suggests increasing standardization.

### Straw

- **Position:** Concept (0.15) and Genesis (0.20)
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis, evolving towards Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Least evolved material, offering minimal protection. Its low position indicates it's a basic, easily accessible option.

### Planning

- **Position:** Visible (0.55) and Product (0.70)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical component linking materials to house protection. Its position suggests it's a well-established practice, key to successful construction.
