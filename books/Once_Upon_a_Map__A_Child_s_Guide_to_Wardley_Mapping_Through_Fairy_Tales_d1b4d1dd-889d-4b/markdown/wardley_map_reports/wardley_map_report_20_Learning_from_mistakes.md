## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the building strategy of the Three Little Pigs, focusing on their choice of materials and learning process in the face of the wolf threat.

**Anchor:** The anchor (user need) is Safety, positioned at the top right of the map. This represents the ultimate goal of the pigs' building efforts and is critical for their survival against the wolf threat.

## Component Analysis

### Safety

- **Position:** Top right (0.95, 0.9)
- **Evolution Stage:** Commodity/Utility
- **Strategic Significance:** Core need driving all other components; critical for survival

### Wolf

- **Position:** Upper right (0.85, 0.8)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Represents the primary threat and driver for improved building strategies

### Building Materials

- **Position:** Pipeline spanning from 0.1 to 0.8 on x-axis
- **Evolution Stage:** Ranges from Genesis to Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Key focus of innovation and strategy; directly impacts safety

### Learning from Mistakes

- **Position:** Middle (0.6, 0.4)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-Built
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for improving strategy and material choices

### Strategy
