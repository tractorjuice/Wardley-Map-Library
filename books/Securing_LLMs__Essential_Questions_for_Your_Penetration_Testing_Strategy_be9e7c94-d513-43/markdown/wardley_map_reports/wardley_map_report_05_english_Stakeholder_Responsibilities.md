## Map Overview

A comprehensive map depicting the hierarchical flow of security responsibilities in LLM implementation, from executive vision to end-user engagement

**Anchor:** Security Vision serves as the anchor, positioned at [0.15, 0.90], representing the foundational strategic direction for LLM security

## Component Analysis

### Executive Leadership

- **Position:** High visibility, high genesis [0.25, 0.85]
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis/Custom
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for setting direction and ensuring resource allocation

### Security Controls

- **Position:** Mid-chain [0.60, 0.55]
- **Evolution Stage:** Product/Rental (0.75)
- **Strategic Significance:** Core operational element requiring standardization

### Training Programs

- **Position:** Lower chain [0.55, 0.15]
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (0.65)
- **Strategic Significance:** Essential for capability development and risk mitigation

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a mature security infrastructure with evolving components in training and controls

### Key Evolving Components
- Security Testing (0.80)
- Security Controls (0.75)
- Training Programs (0.65)

### Disruption Risks
