## Map Overview

A comprehensive map analyzing the security impact assessment of LLM systems within a business context, focusing on risk management, compliance, and operational security

**Anchor:** Business Operations serves as the anchor, representing the core need to maintain secure and effective business operations while implementing LLM systems

## Component Analysis

### Business Operations

- **Position:** High visibility (0.85) and high evolution (0.85)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product/Commodity
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical foundation supporting all other components with noted inertia

### LLM System

- **Position:** Mid-high visibility (0.65) and evolution (0.70)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Core technological component driving business value and risk exposure

### Security Monitoring

- **Position:** Mid visibility (0.48) and lower evolution (0.45)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-Built
- **Strategic Significance:** Essential for risk management and early threat detection
