## Map Overview

A comprehensive map depicting the documentation standards ecosystem for LLM security, focusing on regulatory compliance and security controls

**Anchor:** Customer Need is positioned at high visibility and high evolution, indicating a well-understood and essential requirement for standardized documentation in LLM security

## Component Analysis

### Regulatory Compliance

- **Position:** High visibility, high evolution (0.85, 0.80)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product/Commodity
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical foundation for all documentation activities and security measures

### Documentation Standards

- **Position:** Mid visibility, mid evolution (0.45, 0.65)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom/Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Key differentiator with two distinct levels: Basic Templates and Advanced LLM Specific

### Security Controls

- **Position:** High visibility, high evolution (0.72, 0.70)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Essential for ensuring documentation integrity and access management
