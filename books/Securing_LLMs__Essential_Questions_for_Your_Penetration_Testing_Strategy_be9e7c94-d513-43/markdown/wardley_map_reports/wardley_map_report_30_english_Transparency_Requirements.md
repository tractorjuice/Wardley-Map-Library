## Map Overview

A comprehensive map depicting the transparency and security requirements ecosystem for LLM systems, showing the relationship between stakeholder trust, regulatory compliance, and security controls

**Anchor:** Stakeholder Trust is the primary anchor, positioned high in value chain (0.85) and genesis stage (0.90), indicating its fundamental importance to the system's success

## Component Analysis

### Transparency Framework

- **Position:** High value chain (0.65), custom-built (0.80)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+practice)
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical orchestrating component connecting trust, compliance, and security controls

### Security Controls

- **Position:** Mid-high value chain (0.75), product stage (0.65)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Essential foundation for implementing transparency requirements

### Regulatory Compliance

- **Position:** High value chain (0.82), product stage (0.75)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Mandatory requirement driving many other components

## Evolution Analysis

The system shows a clear evolution from commodity documentation and monitoring components towards more custom-built trust and compliance elements

### Key Evolving Components
- Security Controls (evolving to 0.85)
- Transparency Framework (evolving to 0.75)
- Stakeholder Communication (evolving to 0.65)

### Disruption Risks
- Documentation Review Cycles
- Communication Effectiveness
- Security Impact Assessment

## Value Chain Analysis

Value flows from basic monitoring and assessment activities through documentation and controls to ultimately build stakeholder trust
