## Map Overview

A strategic map focusing on the evolution and movement of components in digital transformation, spanning from experimentation to customer needs

**Anchor:** Customer Needs positioned at [0.95, 0.85], representing the primary driver of value and strategic direction

## Component Analysis

### Customer Needs

- **Position:** High visibility, high evolution (0.95, 0.85)
- **Evolution Stage:** Commodity
- **Strategic Significance:** Primary anchor driving all downstream activities and decisions

### Strategic Opportunities

- **Position:** High visibility, product-commodity boundary (0.82, 0.75)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product/Commodity
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical link between customer needs and transformation initiatives

### Digital Transformation

- **Position:** High-mid visibility, product phase (0.75, 0.70)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Key driver of organizational change and innovation

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a clear evolution path from experimental components to commoditized customer needs
