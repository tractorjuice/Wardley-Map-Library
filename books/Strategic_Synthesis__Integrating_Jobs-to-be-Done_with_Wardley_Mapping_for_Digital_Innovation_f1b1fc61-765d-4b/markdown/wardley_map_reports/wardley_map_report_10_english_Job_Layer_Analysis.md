## Map Overview

A comprehensive map analyzing the layers of job analysis from customer needs to development roadmap, showing the interconnection between functional, emotional, and social aspects of service delivery

**Anchor:** Customer Need positioned at [0.95, 0.85], representing the highest level of visibility and the primary driver for all downstream components

## Component Analysis

### Job-to-be-Done

- **Position:** High visibility (0.90), custom-built (0.75)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-Built/Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical translation point between customer needs and requirement specifications

### Service Delivery

- **Position:** Mid visibility (0.60), product (0.50)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (with evolution indicator 0.75)
- **Strategic Significance:** Central integration point for functional, emotional, and social layers

### Technical Components

- **Position:** Lower visibility (0.45), product (0.40)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (with evolution indicator 0.70)
- **Strategic Significance:** Core infrastructure with inertia, requiring careful evolution management

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a clear evolution from custom solutions towards product and commodity, with technical components and service delivery actively evolving

### Key Evolving Components
- Service Delivery (0.75)
- Technical Components (0.70)

### Disruption Risks
- Operational Elements
- Technical Components due to inertia

## Value Chain Analysis

Value flows from customer need through job definition, requirement layers, to service delivery and technical implementation

### Critical Paths
- Customer Need → Job-to-be-Done → Explicit Requirements → Functional Layer
- Service Delivery → Technical Components → Evolution Monitoring

### Bottlenecks
- Service Delivery integration point
- Technical Components with inertia

## Strategic Positioning

The map shows a well-structured progression from customer needs to technical implementation, with clear separation of concerns between functional, emotional, and social layers
