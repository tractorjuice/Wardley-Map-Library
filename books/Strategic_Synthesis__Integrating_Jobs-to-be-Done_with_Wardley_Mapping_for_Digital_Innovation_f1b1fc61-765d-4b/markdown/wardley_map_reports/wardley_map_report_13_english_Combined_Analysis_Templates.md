## Map Overview

A comprehensive framework for analyzing and implementing job-to-be-done methodologies with Wardley Mapping integration

**Anchor:** Customer Jobs (0.95, 0.85) serves as the anchor, representing the fundamental user needs that drive the entire analysis framework

## Component Analysis

### Customer Jobs

- **Position:** High visibility, high evolution (0.95, 0.85)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+commodity)
- **Strategic Significance:** Foundation of the entire framework, driving all subsequent analysis

### Job Mapping Matrix

- **Position:** Mid visibility, mid evolution (0.65, 0.70)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built (+product)
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical integration point between user needs and analysis tools

### Evolution Tracking Dashboard

- **Position:** Lower visibility, mid evolution (0.45, 0.50)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Key monitoring and control mechanism for implementation
