## Map Overview

A comprehensive map depicting the process of discovering and analyzing business opportunities with focus on customer jobs and strategic implementation

**Anchor:** Customer Jobs serves as the anchor, representing the fundamental user needs that drive the entire opportunity discovery process. Its high visibility (0.95) and relatively high evolution (0.85) indicates a well-understood starting point.

## Component Analysis

### Customer Jobs

- **Position:** High visibility (0.95), high evolution (0.85)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+commodity)
- **Strategic Significance:** Primary driver of value creation, decomposed into functional, emotional, and social aspects

### Strategic Positioning

- **Position:** Mid visibility (0.55), low evolution (0.45)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built (evolving to product)
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical decision point connecting customer insights to implementation considerations

### Technology Assessment

- **Position:** Low visibility (0.35), low evolution (0.35)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Key enabler for implementation feasibility and risk assessment
