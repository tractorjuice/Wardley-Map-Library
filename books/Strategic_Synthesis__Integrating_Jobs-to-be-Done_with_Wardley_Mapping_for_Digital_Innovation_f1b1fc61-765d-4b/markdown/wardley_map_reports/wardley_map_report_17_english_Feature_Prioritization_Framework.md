## Map Overview

A comprehensive framework for prioritizing product features based on customer needs, strategic alignment, and implementation feasibility

**Anchor:** Customer Jobs (0.95, 0.85) serves as the anchor, representing the fundamental user needs that drive the entire prioritization process

## Component Analysis

### Customer Jobs

- **Position:** High visibility, high evolution (0.95, 0.85)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+commodity)
- **Strategic Significance:** Foundation of value creation, drives all downstream decisions

### Priority Scoring Matrix

- **Position:** Mid visibility, mid evolution (0.65, 0.60)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built (+product)
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical decision-making tool connecting customer needs to implementation

### Implementation Feasibility

- **Position:** Low visibility, low evolution (0.35, 0.30)
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis (+custom)
- **Strategic Significance:** Key constraint and risk factor in feature delivery

## Evolution Analysis
