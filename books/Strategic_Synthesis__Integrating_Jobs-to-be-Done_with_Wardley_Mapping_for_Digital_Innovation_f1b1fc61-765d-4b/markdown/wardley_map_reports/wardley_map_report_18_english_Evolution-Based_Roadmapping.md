## Map Overview

A strategic map focusing on the evolution of product development through Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) methodology and evolutionary patterns

**Anchor:** Customer Jobs at [0.85, 0.95] represents the primary user need, indicating a mature understanding of customer requirements as the foundation for all strategic activities

## Component Analysis

### Customer Jobs

- **Position:** High visibility (0.95) and high maturity (0.85)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+commodity)
- **Strategic Significance:** Foundational element with inertia, indicating stable customer needs

### JTBD Analysis

- **Position:** High visibility (0.80) with significant maturity (0.65)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical analytical tool with inertia, linking customer needs to strategic planning

### Platform Evolution

- **Position:** Low visibility (0.30) and genesis stage (0.15)
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis
- **Strategic Significance:** Represents future platform potential and transformation opportunities
