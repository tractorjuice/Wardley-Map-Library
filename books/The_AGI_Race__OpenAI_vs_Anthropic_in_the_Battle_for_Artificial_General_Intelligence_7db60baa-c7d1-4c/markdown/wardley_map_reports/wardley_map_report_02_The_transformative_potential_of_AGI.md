## Map Overview

This Wardley Map depicts the landscape of AGI development, focusing on the approaches of OpenAI and Anthropic, along with the broader implications and components of AGI advancement.

**Anchor:** The anchor is 'User Needs', positioned at the top right, indicating that the entire value chain is driven by and oriented towards fulfilling end-user requirements for AGI capabilities.

## Component Analysis

### AGI

- **Position:** Low visibility, high value
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis/Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Central to the entire map, representing the ultimate goal and driving force behind all other components.

### Large Language Models

- **Position:** High visibility, medium value
- **Evolution Stage:** Product/Rental
- **Strategic Significance:** Current state-of-the-art in AI, serving as a stepping stone towards AGI.

### AI Safety

- **Position:** Medium visibility, high value
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built/Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for responsible AGI development, particularly emphasized in Anthropic's approach.

### Ethical Frameworks

- **Position:** Medium visibility, medium-high value
- **Evolution Stage:** Product/Rental
- **Strategic Significance:** Essential for guiding AGI development and deployment in alignment with human values.

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a landscape where AGI is still in its early stages, while supporting technologies like Large Language Models are more evolved. AI Safety and Ethical Frameworks are in intermediate stages, reflecting their growing importance.
