### Safety

- **Position:** High value, medium-high certainty (0.70, 0.85)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for responsible AGI development and public trust

### Broad Benefit

- **Position:** Medium-high value, medium-high certainty (0.60, 0.80)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Ensures AGI benefits are widely distributed, key for ethical development

### Ethical Development

- **Position:** Medium-high value, medium-high certainty (0.55, 0.75)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Foundational for responsible AGI creation and deployment

### AI Capabilities

- **Position:** High visibility, low certainty (0.85, 0.15)
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis
- **Strategic Significance:** Rapidly evolving core technology, critical for AGI development

### Human Values

- **Position:** Low visibility, low certainty (0.20, 0.10)
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis
- **Strategic Significance:** Fundamental but complex aspect, crucial for aligning AGI with human interests

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a spectrum of evolution stages, with most components in the Product (+rental) phase, indicating a maturing but still developing field.
