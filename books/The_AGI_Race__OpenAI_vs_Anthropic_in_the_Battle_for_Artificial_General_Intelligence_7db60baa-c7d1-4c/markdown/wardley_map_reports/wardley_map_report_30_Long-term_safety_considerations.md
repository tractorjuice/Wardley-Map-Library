## Map Overview

This Wardley Map depicts Anthropic's approach to ensuring the long-term safety of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). It shows a complex ecosystem of interrelated components spanning from fundamental research to practical governance structures.

**Anchor:** The anchor of this map is Human Values, positioned at the top left. This represents the ultimate user need - ensuring AGI aligns with and preserves human values. Its high visibility but low evolution indicates its critical importance and the ongoing challenge of fully defining and implementing human values in AGI systems.

## Component Analysis

### AGI Research

- **Position:** Low visibility, high evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Core to Anthropic's mission, driving the development of safe AGI technologies

### AI Alignment Techniques

- **Position:** Medium visibility, high evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for ensuring AGI systems behave in accordance with human intentions and values

### Ethics Framework

- **Position:** Low visibility, very high evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Provides the ethical foundation for all AGI development and deployment decisions

### Governance Structures

- **Position:** Low visibility, low evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis
- **Strategic Significance:** Essential for managing the societal impact of AGI and ensuring responsible development

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a wide range of evolutionary stages, from genesis (e.g., Governance Structures) to product (e.g., Ethics Framework). This indicates a field in rapid development with some established principles and many areas still being explored.

### Key Evolving Components
- AI Alignment Techniques
- Scalable Oversight
- Fail-safe Systems

### Disruption Risks
- Value Learning
- AI Containment
- AI Treachery Research

## Value Chain Analysis

Value flows from Human Values through the Ethics Framework to inform AGI Research, which then drives the development of various safety and alignment techniques. These techniques feed into more specific tools and approaches for ensuring AGI safety.

### Critical Paths
- Human Values -> Ethics Framework -> AGI Research -> AI Alignment Techniques
- AI Alignment Techniques -> Scalable Oversight/Value Learning/Fail-safe Systems

### Bottlenecks
- Value Learning
