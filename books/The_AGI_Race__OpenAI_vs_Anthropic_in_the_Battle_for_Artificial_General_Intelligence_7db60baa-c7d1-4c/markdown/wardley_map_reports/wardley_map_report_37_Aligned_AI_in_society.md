## Map Overview

This Wardley Map outlines Anthropic's strategy for integrating AGI into society, focusing on building public trust, ensuring regulatory compliance, and developing aligned AI systems.

**Anchor:** The anchor is 'Society' at the top right, representing the ultimate user need and beneficiary of Anthropic's AGI integration efforts. Its high visibility and certainty underscore the critical importance of societal acceptance for AGI deployment.

## Component Analysis

### Public Trust

- **Position:** High visibility, high certainty
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+commodity)
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for societal acceptance of AGI

### Constitutional AI

- **Position:** Medium visibility, high certainty
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Core differentiator for Anthropic's approach to AGI safety

### AGI Systems

- **Position:** Medium visibility, medium certainty
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (evolving)
- **Strategic Significance:** Central to Anthropic's value proposition

### Human-AI Coexistence

- **Position:** Low visibility, low certainty
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis (evolving)
- **Strategic Significance:** Long-term goal for successful AGI integration

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a progression from foundational, less certain components (e.g., Long-term Planning) to more established, certain elements (e.g., Public Trust). This reflects the maturity of different aspects of AGI integration.

### Key Evolving Components
- AGI Systems
- Societal Integration
- Human-AI Coexistence

### Disruption Risks
