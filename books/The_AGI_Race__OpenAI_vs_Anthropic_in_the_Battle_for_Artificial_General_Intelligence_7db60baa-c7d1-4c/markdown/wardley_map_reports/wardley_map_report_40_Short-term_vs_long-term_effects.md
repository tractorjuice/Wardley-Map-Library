## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the evolution of AGI's impact from short-term to long-term effects, focusing on economic, workforce, technological, societal, and ethical dimensions. It also includes the approaches of OpenAI and Anthropic in AGI development.

**Anchor:** The anchor of this map is AGI Development, positioned at [0.3, 0.9]. This represents the core driver of all other components and effects in the system, signifying that AGI development is the primary force shaping the landscape of impacts.

## Component Analysis

### Tech Integration

- **Position:** [0.5, 0.9] - Product with high certainty
- **Evolution Stage:** Late Product (+Rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Represents the pervasive adoption of AGI across various sectors

### Societal Restructuring

- **Position:** [0.2, 0.6] - Genesis/Custom-built with low certainty
- **Evolution Stage:** Early Custom-Built
- **Strategic Significance:** Long-term impact, potentially leading to fundamental changes in social structures

### Ethical Considerations

- **Position:** [0.1, 0.5] - Genesis with low certainty
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis
- **Strategic Significance:** Foundational component that will shape the development and implementation of AGI

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a clear progression from short-term, more certain impacts (Economic Disruption, Tech Integration) to long-term, less certain effects (Societal Restructuring, Ethical Considerations). This evolution suggests that while immediate economic and technological changes are more predictable, the long-term societal and ethical implications are still highly uncertain and in early stages of development.

### Key Evolving Components
- Workforce Transformation
- AI-Human Collaboration
- Educational Paradigms

### Disruption Risks
