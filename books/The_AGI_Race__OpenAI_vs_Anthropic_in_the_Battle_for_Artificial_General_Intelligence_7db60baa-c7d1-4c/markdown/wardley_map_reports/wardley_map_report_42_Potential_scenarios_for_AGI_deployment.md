## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the complex landscape of AGI deployment scenarios and their potential impacts on global power dynamics. It encompasses a range of components from the core AGI technology to its various societal and economic effects, as well as the regulatory and ethical considerations surrounding its deployment.

**Anchor:** The anchor of this map is AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) itself, positioned high on the value chain and relatively far along the evolution axis. This signifies that AGI is the central technology driving all other components and considerations in the map.

## Component Analysis

### AGI

- **Position:** High value, high evolution (0.35, 0.95)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Core technology driving all other components; critical for shaping future scenarios

### Ethical Guidelines

- **Position:** High value, high evolution (0.25, 0.85)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Essential for responsible AGI deployment and public acceptance

### Safety Measures

- **Position:** High value, high evolution (0.30, 0.80)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for mitigating risks associated with AGI deployment

### Economic Impact

- **Position:** High value, moderate evolution (0.40, 0.75)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Key consideration for policymakers and businesses in AGI adoption

### Geopolitical Power Balance

- **Position:** High value, moderate evolution (0.45, 0.65)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical factor in international relations and global stability

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a landscape where AGI and its immediate concerns (ethics, safety) are highly evolved, while broader societal impacts are less evolved. This suggests a need for rapid development in areas like regulatory frameworks and workforce reskilling to keep pace with AGI advancement.

### Key Evolving Components
- AGI
- Ethical Guidelines
- Safety Measures
- Public Perception

### Disruption Risks
- Workforce Reskilling
- Regulatory Frameworks
- Industry Transformation

## Value Chain Analysis

Value flows from AGI through various impact areas (economic, geopolitical, societal) and is shaped by ethical, safety, and regulatory considerations. The flow is moderated by public perception and realized through specific applications and human-AI collaboration.

### Critical Paths
