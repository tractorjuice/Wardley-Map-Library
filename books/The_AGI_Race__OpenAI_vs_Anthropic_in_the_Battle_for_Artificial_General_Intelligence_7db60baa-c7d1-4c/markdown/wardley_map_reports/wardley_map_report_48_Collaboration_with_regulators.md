## Map Overview

This Wardley Map depicts the regulatory landscape in the AGI race, focusing on the collaboration between AI companies (OpenAI and Anthropic) and regulatory bodies. It shows various components related to AI governance, public trust, and safety initiatives.

**Anchor:** The anchor (user need) is AGI, positioned at the top left. This signifies that AGI is the ultimate goal driving all other components and activities in the map, representing the frontier of AI development and the focus of regulatory efforts.

## Component Analysis

### AGI

- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis
- **Strategic Significance:** Core driver of the entire ecosystem, representing the ultimate goal of AI development and the focus of regulatory concerns.

### Regulatory Collaboration

- **Position:** High value, medium evolution (0.35, 0.85)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for ensuring AGI development aligns with societal and safety standards.

### AI Governance

- **Position:** High value, medium-high evolution (0.45, 0.80)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Essential for establishing frameworks to guide AGI development and deployment.

### Public Trust

- **Position:** High value, high evolution (0.60, 0.75)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+)
- **Strategic Significance:** Crucial for societal acceptance and support of AGI development.

### OpenAI and Anthropic

- **Position:** Medium value, medium evolution (0.65-0.70, 0.30-0.35)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Key players in AGI development, their approaches to regulation and safety significantly impact the landscape.

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a progression from less evolved components (AGI, Long-term Safety Focus) to more evolved ones (Public Trust, AI Applications). This indicates a maturing regulatory landscape as AGI development progresses.

### Key Evolving Components
- Regulatory Collaboration
- AI Governance
- RegTech

### Disruption Risks
- AGI
- Ethics-First Approach
- Long-term Safety Focus

## Value Chain Analysis

Value flows from AGI through Regulatory Collaboration and AI Governance to Public Trust. OpenAI and Anthropic contribute to this flow through various initiatives and approaches.

### Critical Paths
- AGI -> Regulatory Collaboration -> AI Governance -> Public Trust

### Bottlenecks
