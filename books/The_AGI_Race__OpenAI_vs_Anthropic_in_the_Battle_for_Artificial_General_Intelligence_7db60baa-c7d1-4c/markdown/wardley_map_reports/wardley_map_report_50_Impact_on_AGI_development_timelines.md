## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the complex interplay between regulatory frameworks, AGI development, and various factors influencing the global AGI race.

**Anchor:** The anchor is the 'AGI Race', representing the ultimate user need driving the entire system. Its position at the top left indicates it's a novel, undefined concept with high visibility.

## Component Analysis

### AGI Development

- **Position:** High value, moderate evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Central to the map, directly influenced by regulatory frameworks and driving technological leadership

### Regulatory Frameworks

- **Position:** Mid-value, high evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Key influencer of AGI development, balancing innovation, safety, and public trust

### Public Trust

- **Position:** Mid-value, moderate evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for funding and support, influenced by regulatory approaches

### Innovation Speed

- **Position:** High value, high evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Directly impacted by regulatory approach, crucial for competitive advantage

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a system in transition, with key components like Regulatory Frameworks and Public-Private Partnerships actively evolving.
