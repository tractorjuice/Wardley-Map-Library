## Map Overview

This Wardley Map depicts the landscape of preparing for an AGI future, showing key stakeholders, governance structures, economic adaptations, educational reforms, and public engagement initiatives.

**Anchor:** The anchor is the Public, positioned at high visibility and high evolution. This signifies that public needs and perceptions are the ultimate driver for all other components in preparing for an AGI future.

## Component Analysis

### AGI Developers

- **Position:** High visibility, high evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for AGI development but need strong governance and public trust

### Policymakers

- **Position:** High visibility, high evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Key in shaping AGI governance, economic adaptation, and public engagement

### AGI Governance

- **Position:** Medium visibility, medium-high evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Crucial for ensuring responsible AGI development and deployment

### Economic Adaptation

- **Position:** Medium visibility, medium evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Essential for managing economic transitions in an AGI world

### Education Reform

- **Position:** Medium visibility, medium evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for preparing the workforce and society for an AGI future
