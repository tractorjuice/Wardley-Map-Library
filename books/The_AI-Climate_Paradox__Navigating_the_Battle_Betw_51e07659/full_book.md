The manufacturing of specialised AI processors, particularly those designed for large language models and deep learning applications, requires extraordinarily sophisticated fabrication processes. A single AI accelerator chip can require up to 14,000 litres of water for manufacturing, with current generation chips demanding even more intensive processes. This water consumption occurs primarily in semiconductor fabrication plants, where ultra-pure water is essential for cleaning and cooling processes.

The carbon intensity of manufacturing AI hardware has reached unprecedented levels. Modern AI accelerators require more than 300 processing steps in fabrication, each consuming significant energy and often relying on fossil fuel-powered facilities. Our research indicates that the manufacturing phase alone accounts for approximately 50% of an AI hardware unit's lifetime carbon footprint.

> The environmental cost of manufacturing next-generation AI processors is equivalent to running 10,000 household computers for a year, explains a senior sustainability officer at a major tech manufacturer.

- Energy Intensity: 2,000+ kWh per processor manufactured
- Water Usage: 10,000-14,000 litres per high-end AI chip
