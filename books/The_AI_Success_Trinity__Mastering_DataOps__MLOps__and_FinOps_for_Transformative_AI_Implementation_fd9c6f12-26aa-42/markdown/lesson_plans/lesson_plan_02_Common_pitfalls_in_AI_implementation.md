**Learner Activities:** In small groups, analyze assigned pitfalls, research examples, and prepare to present findings.

**Resources Used:** Wardley Map, research materials, presentation tools

**Differentiation:** Assign pitfalls based on learners' expertise levels

**Technology Integration:** Utilize collaborative online research tools and digital whiteboards

### Explain
**Duration:** 60 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Facilitate group presentations on pitfalls. Provide expert insights and real-world examples for each pitfall.

**Learner Activities:** Present group findings, engage in Q&A, take notes on other presentations

**Resources Used:** Presentation slides, expert commentary

**Differentiation:** Encourage peer teaching and varied presentation styles

**Technology Integration:** Use screen sharing for presentations, encourage use of multimedia elements

### Elaborate
**Duration:** 60 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Introduce the concepts of DataOps, MLOps, and FinOps. Guide a discussion on how these practices address the pitfalls.

**Learner Activities:** Participate in facilitated discussion, work on mapping pitfalls to relevant Ops practices

**Resources Used:** DataOps, MLOps, FinOps framework guides

**Differentiation:** Provide additional resources for those new to Ops concepts

**Technology Integration:** Use collaborative mind mapping tools to visualize connections

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present a new AI implementation scenario. Guide learners in developing a risk mitigation plan.

**Learner Activities:** Work in groups to create a comprehensive risk mitigation plan for the given scenario

**Resources Used:** AI implementation scenario, risk mitigation template

**Differentiation:** Offer scenarios of varying complexity

**Technology Integration:** Use project management tools to create and share plans

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Ongoing observation of group discussions and presentations
  - Alignment: Assesses ability to analyze and evaluate AI implementation challenges
* **Summative**: Evaluation of final risk mitigation plan
  - Alignment: Assesses ability to design comprehensive strategies addressing AI implementation pitfalls

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice AI practitioners**: Provide additional background resources, pair with experienced peers
* **Experienced AI practitioners**: Offer more complex scenarios, encourage leadership in group activities

## Cross-Disciplinary Connections
* Project management principles
* Change management theories
* Data science and analytics
* Public policy and governance

## Real-World Applications
* Developing AI strategies for government agencies
* Implementing AI-driven public services
* Managing data governance in large-scale AI projects
* Addressing ethical concerns in AI-based decision making systems

## Metacognition Opportunities
