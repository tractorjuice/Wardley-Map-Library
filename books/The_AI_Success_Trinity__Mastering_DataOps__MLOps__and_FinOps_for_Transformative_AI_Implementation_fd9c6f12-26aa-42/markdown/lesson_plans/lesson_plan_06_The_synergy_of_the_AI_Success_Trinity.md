**Resources Used:** Case study materials, strategy template, presentation tools

**Differentiation:** Provide additional guidance or advanced challenges based on group progress

**Technology Integration:** Use project management tools to outline implementation strategies

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Facilitate peer evaluation of group strategies. Provide expert feedback on the feasibility and completeness of proposed solutions.

**Learner Activities:** Present strategies, evaluate peer presentations, reflect on feedback received

**Resources Used:** Evaluation rubric, feedback forms

**Differentiation:** Tailor feedback to each group's specific public sector focus

**Technology Integration:** Use online forms for peer and self-assessment

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Observation of group discussions and jigsaw activity participation
  - Alignment: Assesses understanding of individual components and their interactions
* **Summative**: Evaluation of final group strategy for implementing AI using the Trinity framework
  - Alignment: Assesses ability to apply the framework to real-world public sector challenges
* **Summative**: Individual reflection paper on how the AI Success Trinity could be applied in their specific role or department
  - Alignment: Evaluates ability to contextualize learning to personal professional situations
