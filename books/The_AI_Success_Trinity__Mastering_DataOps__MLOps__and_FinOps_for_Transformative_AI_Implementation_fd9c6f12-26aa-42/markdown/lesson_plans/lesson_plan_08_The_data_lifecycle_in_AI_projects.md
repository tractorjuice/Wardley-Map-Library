## Lesson Structure
### Engage
**Duration:** 20 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present a real-world public sector AI project failure due to poor data lifecycle management. Facilitate a brief discussion on potential causes.

**Learner Activities:** Participate in discussion, sharing experiences and hypotheses about the project failure.

**Resources Used:** Case study presentation, discussion prompts

**Differentiation:** Provide additional context for those less familiar with public sector AI projects

**Technology Integration:** Use interactive polling software to gather initial thoughts on data lifecycle challenges

### Explore
**Duration:** 40 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide learners through a collaborative mapping exercise of the data lifecycle stages using an online whiteboard tool.

**Learner Activities:** In small groups, map out the data lifecycle stages and identify potential challenges and best practices for each stage.

**Resources Used:** Online collaborative whiteboard, data lifecycle stage descriptions

**Differentiation:** Assign roles within groups based on expertise levels

**Technology Integration:** Utilize breakout rooms for group work and shared online whiteboard for collaboration

### Explain
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present a comprehensive overview of the data lifecycle stages, incorporating insights from the exploration phase. Highlight key considerations for public sector AI projects.

**Learner Activities:** Take notes, ask questions, and relate the presented information to their mapped lifecycle stages.

**Resources Used:** Slide presentation, interactive Q&A

**Differentiation:** Provide additional resources for deeper dives into specific stages

**Technology Integration:** Use interactive presentation software with embedded quizzes and polls

### Elaborate
**Duration:** 50 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Introduce a complex public sector AI project scenario. Guide learners through applying the data lifecycle concepts to optimize the project's DataOps strategy.

**Learner Activities:** Work in teams to develop a DataOps strategy for the given scenario, addressing each lifecycle stage.

**Resources Used:** Project scenario description, strategy template

**Differentiation:** Provide varying levels of complexity in project scenarios

**Technology Integration:** Use project management tools to outline and present strategies

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 25 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Facilitate team presentations of DataOps strategies. Lead a peer evaluation and discussion session.

**Learner Activities:** Present strategies, provide peer feedback, and reflect on learning and application to own projects.

**Resources Used:** Evaluation rubric, peer feedback forms

**Differentiation:** Offer multiple presentation formats (e.g., verbal, visual, written)

**Technology Integration:** Use digital feedback tools for real-time peer evaluations

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Ongoing observation and feedback during group activities and discussions
  - Alignment: Assesses understanding and application of data lifecycle concepts in real-time
* **Summative**: Evaluation of final DataOps strategy presentations
  - Alignment: Assesses ability to synthesize learning into a comprehensive strategy for a real-world scenario
* **Summative**: Post-workshop action plan for implementing data lifecycle optimizations in learners' own projects
  - Alignment: Evaluates ability to transfer learning to personal professional context

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice data professionals**: Provide additional explanations of technical concepts, pair with more experienced peers during group work
* **Experienced AI practitioners**: Offer advanced case studies, encourage them to share experiences and mentor others
* **Project managers**: Focus on strategic and governance aspects of data lifecycle management, emphasize cross-functional collaboration

## Cross-Disciplinary Connections
* Information security and data privacy
* Public policy and governance
* Ethics in AI and data management
* Project management and agile methodologies

## Real-World Applications
* Optimizing data pipelines for predictive maintenance in public infrastructure
* Enhancing citizen services through AI-driven chatbots with robust data management
* Improving public health outcomes through data-driven policy decisions
* Streamlining government operations with AI-powered process automation

## Metacognition Opportunities
* Reflection on personal data management practices and areas for improvement
* Self-assessment of strengths and weaknesses in each data lifecycle stage
* Journaling on the challenges and opportunities of implementing DataOps in current projects

## Extension Activities
* Develop a detailed DataOps implementation plan for a specific department or agency
* Conduct a data lifecycle audit of an existing AI project and propose optimizations
* Create a training module on one specific data lifecycle stage for team members

## Safety Considerations
* Ensure discussions of public sector data adhere to confidentiality and security protocols
* Address ethical considerations in AI data management, particularly regarding citizen privacy

## Reflection Questions
### For Learners
* How can you apply the data lifecycle concepts to improve your current AI projects?
* What challenges do you anticipate in implementing robust DataOps practices in your organization?
