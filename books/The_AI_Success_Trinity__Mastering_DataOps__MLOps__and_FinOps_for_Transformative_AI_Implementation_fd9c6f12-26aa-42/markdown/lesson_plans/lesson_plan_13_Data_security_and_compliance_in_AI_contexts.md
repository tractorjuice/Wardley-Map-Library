**Resources Used:** Jupyter notebooks with pre-configured environments, sample datasets

**Differentiation:** Offer varying levels of complexity in exercises

**Technology Integration:** Use cloud-based Jupyter environments for hands-on practice

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide learners through a reflection process and facilitate the creation of action plans

**Learner Activities:** Develop a preliminary action plan for enhancing AI security and compliance in their organizations

**Resources Used:** Action plan templates, self-assessment rubrics

**Differentiation:** Provide one-on-one consultations for specific organizational contexts

**Technology Integration:** Use digital templates for action planning and peer review

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Continuous assessment through Q&A and group discussions
  - Alignment: Aligns with objectives by gauging understanding of AI security challenges and compliance requirements
* **Summative**: Evaluation of the action plans developed by learners
  - Alignment: Assesses ability to design comprehensive strategies for AI security and compliance
* **Practical**: Performance in hands-on exercises with privacy-preserving techniques
  - Alignment: Directly assesses the application of privacy-preserving techniques in AI workflows

## Differentiation Strategies
