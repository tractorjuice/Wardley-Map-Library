**Resources Used:** Sample datasets, data quality tools (e.g., Great Expectations)

**Differentiation:** Provide datasets of varying complexity to challenge different skill levels.

**Technology Integration:** Use screen sharing to demonstrate tool usage, and provide virtual breakout rooms for group work.

### Explain
**Duration:** 60 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present detailed information on continuous data testing and monitoring concepts, best practices, and their relevance to AI success. Discuss the cultural shift required for effective implementation.

**Learner Activities:** Take notes, ask questions, and participate in discussions on how these concepts apply to their specific organizational contexts.

**Resources Used:** Presentation slides, interactive Q&A session

**Differentiation:** Provide supplementary reading materials for those who want to dive deeper into specific topics.

**Technology Integration:** Use an interactive presentation tool with embedded quizzes to check understanding.

### Elaborate
**Duration:** 60 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Facilitate a hands-on workshop where learners design a continuous data testing and monitoring strategy for a hypothetical AI project in a government agency.

**Learner Activities:** Work in teams to create a comprehensive plan, including tool selection, process design, and cultural change strategies.

**Resources Used:** Strategy template, list of available tools and technologies

**Differentiation:** Assign roles within teams based on individual strengths and experiences.

**Technology Integration:** Use collaborative online tools (e.g., Miro, Google Docs) for strategy development.

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide learners through a peer review process of their strategies. Provide feedback and facilitate reflection on learning.

**Learner Activities:** Present strategies to peers, provide constructive feedback, and reflect on personal learning and application to their work.

**Resources Used:** Evaluation rubric, reflection prompts

**Differentiation:** Offer optional advanced challenges for quick finishers.

**Technology Integration:** Use a digital feedback tool for peer evaluations and self-reflection submissions.

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Ongoing observation and questioning during group activities and discussions
  - Alignment: Assesses understanding of key concepts and ability to apply them in context
* **Summative**: Evaluation of the continuous data testing and monitoring strategy developed during the Elaborate phase
  - Alignment: Assesses ability to synthesize learning into a practical, professional-level plan

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice data professionals**: Provide additional guidance on tool usage, offer simplified datasets for initial practice
* **Experienced AI engineers**: Offer advanced scenarios, encourage them to share experiences and mentor others

## Cross-Disciplinary Connections
* IT governance and compliance
* Project management
* Organizational change management
* Data ethics and privacy

## Real-World Applications
* Implementing data quality checks in existing government AI systems
* Developing data monitoring dashboards for public sector AI projects
* Creating data quality policies for AI initiatives in regulatory agencies

## Metacognition Opportunities
* Reflection on personal data quality practices and areas for improvement
* Self-assessment of readiness to implement continuous testing and monitoring in current projects

## Extension Activities
* Conduct a data quality audit of an existing AI system in the learner's organization
* Develop a proposal for implementing a new data quality tool in the workplace

## Safety Considerations
* Ensure discussions about data quality do not reveal sensitive information about government systems
* Address ethical considerations in AI data usage and monitoring

## Reflection Questions
### For Learners
* How can you apply today's learnings to improve data quality in your current AI projects?
* What challenges do you anticipate in implementing continuous data testing and monitoring in your organization, and how might you overcome them?

### For Facilitator
