### Elaborate
**Duration:** 60 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Introduce a complex public sector AI implementation scenario. Guide learners in applying MLOps principles to address the scenario's challenges.

**Learner Activities:** Work in cross-functional teams to develop an MLOps strategy for the given scenario, considering ethical and regulatory requirements

**Resources Used:** Scenario description, MLOps strategy template

**Differentiation:** Assign roles within teams based on individual expertise and learning goals

**Technology Integration:** Use of project management tools to outline MLOps strategy

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Facilitate team presentations of MLOps strategies. Lead a peer evaluation and discussion session.

**Learner Activities:** Present team strategies, provide constructive feedback to other teams, reflect on learning

**Resources Used:** Evaluation rubric, peer feedback forms

**Differentiation:** Offer various presentation formats (e.g., verbal, visual, written) to accommodate different strengths

**Technology Integration:** Use of digital presentation tools and online feedback submission

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Ongoing observation and questioning during exploration and elaboration phases
  - Alignment: Assesses understanding of MLOps concepts and ability to apply them to public sector contexts
* **Summative**: Evaluation of team MLOps strategy presentations
  - Alignment: Assesses ability to synthesize learning and create practical MLOps implementation plans
* **Summative**: Individual reflection paper on applying MLOps in their organization
  - Alignment: Evaluates ability to connect learning to specific professional contexts and challenges

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice AI practitioners**: Provide additional explanations of AI concepts, pair with more experienced learners during group activities
* **Experienced data scientists**: Offer advanced scenarios focusing on optimizing MLOps processes, encourage them to share experiences with the group
* **IT operations professionals**: Focus on deployment, monitoring, and maintenance aspects of MLOps, relate to existing IT governance frameworks

* Optimizing resource allocation in emergency services using AI

## Metacognition Opportunities
* Reflection on personal biases and assumptions about AI in government
* Self-assessment of MLOps knowledge gaps and learning needs
* Group discussion on ethical considerations in public sector AI implementation

## Extension Activities
* Develop a detailed MLOps implementation plan for a specific department or agency
* Create a risk assessment framework for AI projects using MLOps principles
* Design a training program to build MLOps capabilities within a public sector organization

## Safety Considerations
* Ensure discussions of public sector AI projects respect data privacy and security protocols
* Address potential ethical concerns in AI implementation scenarios
* Highlight the importance of inclusivity and fairness in AI systems for public use

## Reflection Questions
### For Learners
* How can MLOps principles improve the AI initiatives in your organization?
