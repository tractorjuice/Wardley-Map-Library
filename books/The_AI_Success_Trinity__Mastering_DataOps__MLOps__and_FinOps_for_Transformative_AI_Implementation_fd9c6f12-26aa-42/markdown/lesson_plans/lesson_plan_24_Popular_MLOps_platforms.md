**Learner Activities:** Present group findings, engage in Q&A, and take notes on other platforms presented

**Resources Used:** Presentation slides, group findings

**Differentiation:** Provide additional explanations for complex features as needed

**Technology Integration:** Use screen sharing for presentations and interactive Q&A tools

### Elaborate
**Duration:** 50 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Introduce a case study of a government AI project. Guide learners through the process of selecting an appropriate MLOps platform for the project.

**Learner Activities:** Analyze the case study, apply selection criteria, and justify platform choices in small groups

**Resources Used:** Case study materials, selection criteria checklist

**Differentiation:** Provide varying levels of complexity in case studies

**Technology Integration:** Use decision matrix tools for platform comparison and selection

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 25 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Facilitate group presentations of platform selections and rationales. Lead a reflective discussion on the decision-making process.

**Learner Activities:** Present and defend platform choices, provide peer feedback, reflect on learning and application to own work context

**Resources Used:** Presentation tools, peer feedback forms

**Differentiation:** Offer alternative presentation formats (e.g., written report, oral presentation)

**Technology Integration:** Use online feedback tools for peer and self-assessment

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Observation of group discussions and platform exploration process
  - Alignment: Assesses ability to analyze MLOps platforms (Learning Objective 1)
* **Summative**: Evaluation of final platform selection and justification for case study
  - Alignment: Assesses ability to evaluate platforms and design selection strategies (Learning Objectives 2 and 3)

## Differentiation Strategies
