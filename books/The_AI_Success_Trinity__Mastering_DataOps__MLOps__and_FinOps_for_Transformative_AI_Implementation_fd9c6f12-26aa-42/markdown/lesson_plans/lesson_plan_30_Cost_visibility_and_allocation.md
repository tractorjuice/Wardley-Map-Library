**Learner Activities:** Take notes and participate in Q&A sessions after each key concept presentation.

**Resources Used:** Slide deck, interactive polling tool

**Differentiation:** Provide supplementary reading materials for those wanting deeper insights

**Technology Integration:** Use interactive presentation software with embedded quizzes

### Elaborate
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Introduce a scenario-based activity where learners must develop a cost visibility and allocation plan for a fictional AI project.

**Learner Activities:** Work in small teams to create a comprehensive plan, including tagging strategies, monitoring dashboards, and allocation policies.

**Resources Used:** Scenario description, plan template, virtual whiteboard

**Differentiation:** Offer different complexity levels of AI projects to suit varying expertise

**Technology Integration:** Use collaborative project management tools for plan development

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Facilitate a peer review session of the developed plans, providing a rubric for evaluation.

**Learner Activities:** Present plans to another team, provide and receive constructive feedback based on the rubric.

**Resources Used:** Evaluation rubric, peer feedback form

**Differentiation:** Encourage teams to focus feedback on areas most relevant to their professional contexts

**Technology Integration:** Use online forms for structured peer feedback submission

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Ongoing observation and questioning during group activities and discussions
  - Alignment: Assesses understanding of key concepts and ability to apply them in discussions
* **Summative**: Evaluation of the final cost visibility and allocation plan developed by each team
  - Alignment: Assesses ability to synthesize learning into a practical, professional-level deliverable

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice professionals**: Provide additional explanations of AI-specific terminology, offer more structured templates for activities
* **Experienced professionals**: Encourage deeper analysis, provide opportunities to share real-world experiences, assign mentor roles in group activities

## Cross-Disciplinary Connections
* Link to project management methodologies
* Explore connections with data governance practices
* Discuss implications for organizational change management
