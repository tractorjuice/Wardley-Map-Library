**Learner Activities:** Work in teams to create a FinOps team structure and draft a governance framework for a fictional AI project

**Resources Used:** Role cards, governance framework template

**Differentiation:** Assign roles based on learners' professional backgrounds

**Technology Integration:** Use collaborative online tools for team planning and document creation

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide learners through a reflection process and facilitate peer evaluations of team designs

**Learner Activities:** Present team designs, provide peer feedback, and complete a self-assessment

**Resources Used:** Evaluation rubric, self-assessment form

**Differentiation:** Offer choice in presentation format (e.g., verbal, visual, written)

**Technology Integration:** Use a digital feedback tool for real-time peer evaluations

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Observation of group discussions and hands-on activities
  - Alignment: Assesses understanding of FinOps principles and tool usage in real-time
* **Summative**: Peer and facilitator evaluation of team-designed FinOps structures and governance frameworks
  - Alignment: Evaluates ability to apply learned concepts to realistic AI project scenarios
* **Summative**: Individual reflection paper on implementing collaborative cost management in their organization
  - Alignment: Assesses ability to contextualize learning to personal professional situations

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice AI professionals**: Provide additional background materials on AI project lifecycles and basic FinOps concepts
* **Experienced finance professionals**: Offer advanced scenarios focusing on complex AI cost attribution challenges
* **IT and data science professionals**: Emphasize technical aspects of integrating FinOps tools with MLOps platforms

## Cross-Disciplinary Connections

* Conduct a mini-audit of a recent or ongoing AI project using FinOps principles

## Safety Considerations
* Ensure data privacy when discussing real-world examples
* Address potential conflicts between cost management and innovation goals
* Discuss ethical considerations in AI cost optimization

## Reflection Questions
### For Learners
* How can you promote a culture of cost awareness in your current role?
* What challenges do you anticipate in implementing collaborative cost management, and how might you address them?
* How does this approach to cost management align with or challenge your organization's current practices?

### For Facilitator
* How effectively did the hands-on activities engage learners from diverse professional backgrounds?
* What aspects of collaborative cost management seemed to resonate most with the learners?
* How can the lesson be improved to better address the varied needs of professional learners?
