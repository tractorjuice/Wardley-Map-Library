**Learner Activities:** Create Wardley maps in groups to visualize the relationships between the three Ops disciplines

**Resources Used:** Wardley mapping software, objectives cheat sheet

**Differentiation:** Offer pre-made templates for less experienced mappers

**Technology Integration:** Utilize online Wardley mapping tool for collaborative work

### Explain
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present key concepts of aligning Ops objectives, emphasizing synergies and potential conflicts

**Learner Activities:** Take notes and participate in Q&A session

**Resources Used:** Presentation slides, interactive diagrams

**Differentiation:** Provide glossary of terms for those less familiar with specific concepts

**Technology Integration:** Use interactive presentation software with embedded quizzes

### Elaborate
**Duration:** 90 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Facilitate a workshop on developing cross-functional KPIs and governance structures

**Learner Activities:** Work in cross-functional teams to design KPIs and propose governance models

**Resources Used:** KPI development worksheet, governance structure templates

**Differentiation:** Assign roles based on learners' backgrounds to ensure diverse perspectives

**Technology Integration:** Use collaborative document editing for real-time team work

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide learners through a reflection process and facilitate peer evaluation of proposed strategies

**Learner Activities:** Present team strategies, provide peer feedback, and reflect on learning

**Resources Used:** Evaluation rubric, reflection prompts

**Differentiation:** Offer choice in presentation format (verbal, visual, written)

**Technology Integration:** Use digital feedback tools for peer evaluations

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Observation of group discussions and Wardley mapping exercise
  - Alignment: Assesses ability to analyze interconnections between Ops disciplines
* **Formative**: Review of developed cross-functional KPIs
  - Alignment: Evaluates ability to create integrated performance metrics
* **Summative**: Peer evaluation of proposed alignment strategies
  - Alignment: Assesses ability to design and evaluate integrated Ops approaches

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice AI professionals**: Provide additional background readings, pair with more experienced peers
* **Experienced Ops specialists**: Offer advanced case studies, encourage mentoring of less experienced peers

## Cross-Disciplinary Connections
* Project management methodologies
* Organizational change management
* Public policy and governance
* Data ethics and privacy

## Real-World Applications
* Optimizing government AI initiatives for cost-effectiveness and public trust
* Improving cross-departmental collaboration in public sector AI projects
* Enhancing transparency and accountability in AI-driven public services

## Metacognition Opportunities
* Reflection on personal biases towards specific Ops disciplines
* Self-assessment of cross-functional collaboration skills
* Journaling on the evolution of understanding throughout the lesson

## Extension Activities
* Develop a detailed implementation plan for aligning Ops in learners' organizations
* Create a case study based on a real project in the learner's workplace
* Design a training module for colleagues on integrated Ops approaches

## Safety Considerations
* Ensure discussions of real projects maintain confidentiality
* Address potential resistance to cross-functional integration sensitively

## Reflection Questions
### For Learners
* How has your perception of Ops alignment changed?
* What challenges do you anticipate in implementing these concepts in your organization?
* How might this integrated approach impact your role and responsibilities?

### For Facilitator
* How effectively did the Wardley mapping exercise illustrate the concepts?
* Were there any unexpected insights or challenges that emerged during the lesson?
* How can the lesson be improved to better address the diverse needs of the learners?

## Adaptations for Virtual Learning
* Use breakout rooms for small group discussions and activities
* Employ virtual whiteboarding tools for collaborative exercises
* Utilize asynchronous discussion forums for extended reflection and peer interaction

## Additional Resources
* Wardley Mapping guide for AI operations
* Case studies of successful Ops alignment in government AI projects
* Webinar series on implementing cross-functional AI governance
