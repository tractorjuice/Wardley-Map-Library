**Resources Used:** Action plan template, best practices guide

**Differentiation:** Provide one-on-one coaching for learners with specific organizational challenges

**Technology Integration:** Use digital collaboration tools for action plan creation and sharing

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Administer a scenario-based assessment and facilitate peer feedback on action plans.

**Learner Activities:** Complete the assessment and provide constructive feedback on peers' action plans.

**Resources Used:** Scenario-based assessment tool

**Differentiation:** Offer choice in assessment format (written, presentation, or discussion)

**Technology Integration:** Use online assessment platform with immediate feedback

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Observation of participation and contributions during the AI project simulation
  - Alignment: Assesses ability to apply collaboration strategies in a simulated professional environment
* **Summative**: Scenario-based assessment evaluating learners' ability to identify and resolve cross-functional challenges in AI projects
  - Alignment: Aligns with learning objectives on analyzing importance and evaluating impact of cross-functional collaboration
* **Summative**: Evaluation of the action plan for implementing cross-functional collaboration in learners' organizations
  - Alignment: Directly assesses the ability to create strategies for real-world application

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice AI professionals**: Provide additional background on AI lifecycle, offer mentoring from experienced peers during activities
* **Experienced AI leaders**: Assign leadership roles in group activities, encourage sharing of complex real-world examples
* **Specialists in one Ops area**: Ensure exposure to other Ops areas during simulation, provide supplementary materials on unfamiliar domains

## Cross-Disciplinary Connections
* Project management principles for effective collaboration
* Organizational psychology concepts for overcoming cultural barriers
* Data ethics considerations in cross-functional AI projects

## Real-World Applications
