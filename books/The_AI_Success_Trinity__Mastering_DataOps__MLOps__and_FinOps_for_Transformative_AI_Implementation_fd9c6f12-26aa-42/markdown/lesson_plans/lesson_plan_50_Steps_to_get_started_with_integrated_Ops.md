## Lesson Structure
### Engage
**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present a real-world scenario of an organization struggling with AI implementation due to siloed operations. Facilitate a discussion on potential challenges and impacts.

**Learner Activities:** Participate in group discussion, sharing experiences and insights from their own organizations.

**Resources Used:** Case study presentation

**Differentiation:** Encourage participants to relate the scenario to their specific organizational contexts.

**Technology Integration:** Use interactive polling software to gather initial thoughts on integrated Ops challenges.

### Explore
**Duration:** 60 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide learners through a self-assessment of their organization's current AI operations using a provided template. Introduce the concept of the AI Success Trinity.

**Learner Activities:** Complete the AI operations assessment, identifying gaps and areas for improvement in their organizations.

**Resources Used:** AI operations assessment template

**Differentiation:** Provide additional support for those less familiar with certain Ops disciplines.

**Technology Integration:** Use a digital form for the assessment that provides instant analysis and visualization of results.

### Explain
**Duration:** 60 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present the 10-step roadmap for implementing integrated Ops, explaining each step in detail with examples.

**Learner Activities:** Take notes, ask questions, and participate in discussions on how each step applies to their organization.

**Resources Used:** Presentation slides, Wardley Map

**Differentiation:** Provide additional real-world examples for complex concepts.

**Technology Integration:** Use an interactive Wardley Map tool to visualize the implementation journey.

### Elaborate
**Duration:** 60 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Facilitate a group activity where learners design an integrated Ops implementation plan for a fictional organization.

**Learner Activities:** Work in small groups to create an implementation plan, including team structure, strategy alignment, and KPIs.

**Resources Used:** Implementation plan template, sample KPI dashboard

**Differentiation:** Assign roles within groups based on individual strengths and experiences.

**Technology Integration:** Use collaborative online tools for group work and plan creation.

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide learners through a peer review process of their implementation plans. Facilitate a whole-group discussion on key takeaways and next steps.

**Learner Activities:** Present group plans, provide constructive feedback to peers, and reflect on personal learning and application.

**Resources Used:** Peer review rubric

**Differentiation:** Offer alternative presentation formats (e.g., written, verbal, visual) to accommodate different communication styles.

**Technology Integration:** Use a digital feedback tool for peer reviews and final reflections.

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Observation of group discussions and activities throughout the lesson
  - Alignment: Assesses understanding and application of concepts in real-time
* **Summative**: Evaluation of the integrated Ops implementation plan created by each group
  - Alignment: Assesses ability to synthesize learning into a practical, professional-context plan
* **Summative**: Individual reflection on how they will apply the roadmap in their organization
  - Alignment: Evaluates ability to transfer learning to specific professional contexts

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice AI practitioners**: Provide additional resources on basic AI and Ops concepts; pair with more experienced learners during group activities
* **Experienced AI leaders**: Offer advanced case studies; encourage them to share experiences and mentor others during activities

## Cross-Disciplinary Connections
* Project management principles for implementation planning
* Change management strategies for organizational adoption
* Data governance and compliance considerations

## Real-World Applications
* Improving efficiency and effectiveness of AI projects in government agencies
* Enhancing cross-departmental collaboration in public sector organizations
* Optimizing AI-related costs in budget-constrained environments

## Metacognition Opportunities
* Reflection on personal biases towards certain Ops disciplines
* Self-assessment of readiness to lead integrated Ops initiatives
* Identification of knowledge gaps and personal development needs

## Extension Activities
* Develop a detailed 90-day plan for initiating integrated Ops in their organization
* Create a presentation to pitch integrated Ops to senior leadership
* Design a training program for building integrated Ops capabilities in their team

## Safety Considerations
* Ensure discussions about organizational challenges remain constructive and confidential
* Address potential resistance to change and job security concerns related to Ops integration

## Reflection Questions
### For Learners
* How does the integrated Ops approach challenge your current way of working?
* What are the biggest obstacles you foresee in implementing this in your organization?
* How can you leverage your strengths to drive the adoption of integrated Ops?

### For Facilitator
* How effectively did the lesson address the diverse experience levels in the group?
* What aspects of the integrated Ops concept seemed to resonate most with learners?
* How can the lesson be improved to better address the specific challenges of government and public sector organizations?

## Adaptations for Virtual Learning
* Use breakout rooms for small group activities
* Leverage virtual whiteboards for collaborative planning exercises
* Incorporate more frequent check-ins and shorter activity durations to maintain engagement

## Additional Resources
* Case studies of successful integrated Ops implementations in government organizations
* Whitepapers on the AI Success Trinity and its impact on public sector innovation
* Online communities and forums for ongoing discussion and support in integrated Ops adoption
