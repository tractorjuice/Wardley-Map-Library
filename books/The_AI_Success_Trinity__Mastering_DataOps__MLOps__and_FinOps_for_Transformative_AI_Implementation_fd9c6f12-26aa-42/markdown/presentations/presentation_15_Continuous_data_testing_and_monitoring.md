# Continuous Data Testing and Monitoring in AI
## A Critical Component of DataOps

---

# Why It Matters

- Ensures ongoing quality, reliability, and relevance of data
- Critical for sustainable AI outcomes
- Prevents propagation of data issues through AI models
- Maintains AI system efficacy over time

---

# Continuous Data Testing

- Systematic and automated verification of data quality
- Ongoing process aligned with agile AI development

Key components:
1. Data profiling
2. Data validation
3. Data consistency checks
4. Data completeness tests
5. Data format and type checks

---

# Data Monitoring

- Real-time observation and analysis of data ecosystem
- Enables prompt detection of anomalies, drift, or degradation

Key components:
1. Real-time data quality dashboards
2. Automated alerting systems
3. Performance tracking
4. Data drift detection
5. Usage analytics
