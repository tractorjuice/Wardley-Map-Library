## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the journey of implementing an integrated operations approach for AI, focusing on the AI Success Trinity of DataOps, MLOps, and FinOps.

**Anchor:** The anchor is 'Organisational Goals' at the top of the map, signifying that all components and strategies ultimately serve to achieve these high-level objectives.

## Component Analysis

### AI Success Trinity

- **Position:** High value, custom-built
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Central to the strategy, bridging organizational goals with specific operational domains

### Integrated Ops Strategy

- **Position:** Medium value, custom-built
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Key in aligning various operational aspects and driving the implementation journey

### Cross-functional AI Ops Team

- **Position:** Medium value, custom-built
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for successful implementation and ongoing management of integrated ops

### Current AI Operations Assessment
