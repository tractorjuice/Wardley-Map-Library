Well, in AI, it's more like 'quality in, innovation out'. Let's explore why these elements are the bedrock of successful AI implementation.

First up, let's talk about the six dimensions of data quality. Data quality isn't just about having 'good' data. It's about ensuring your data hits the mark in six crucial dimensions: accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, validity, and uniqueness.

Accuracy means your data correctly represents reality. Completeness ensures you have all the required data. Consistency maintains uniform representation across systems. Timeliness guarantees your data is up-to-date. Validity confirms adherence to defined formats and rules. And uniqueness eliminates duplicates that could skew your results.

Now, let's talk about data governance. Think of it as the rulebook for your data game. It's not just about quality; it's about ensuring your data use is ethical, compliant, and trustworthy. Key components include data cataloguing, lineage tracking, access control, quality monitoring, compliance management, ethical use guidelines, and data stewardship.

Implementing these components requires both technological solutions and organizational change. It's about integrating advanced tools into your DataOps pipeline and fostering a data-centric culture.

Speaking of culture, let's discuss how to build a data-centric mindset in your organization. It's not just about tools and processes; it's about people.
