## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the evolution of NATO's strategic planning, focusing on the integration of Wardley Mapping into the NATO Warfighting Capability Concept (NWCC). It showcases the interplay between traditional military doctrine and emerging methodologies for strategic analysis and planning.

**Anchor:** The anchor appears to be the NATO Alliance, positioned at the top right of the map. This signifies that all components and strategies ultimately serve the needs and objectives of the NATO Alliance.

## Component Analysis

### Traditional Military Doctrine

- **Position:** High visibility, high evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+commodity)
- **Strategic Significance:** Forms the foundation of current military strategy but is evolving towards more modern approaches

### Wardley Mapping

- **Position:** Low visibility, mid evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Represents a novel approach to strategic planning, with potential to significantly impact NATO's decision-making processes

### NWCC Integration

- **Position:** Low visibility, low evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for modernizing NATO's strategic capabilities and incorporating new methodologies

### Multi-Domain Operations

- **Position:** Mid visibility, high evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Essential for addressing modern warfare complexities across various operational domains
