## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the concept of Multi-Domain Operations, showcasing its components, dependencies, and evolutionary stages within the context of modern warfare.

**Anchor:** The anchor is Multi-Domain Operations itself, positioned at [0.65, 0.90], indicating its strategic importance and relatively mature stage in the evolution axis.

## Component Analysis

### Multi-Domain Operations

- **Position:** Positioned high on the value chain and relatively far along the evolution axis [0.65, 0.90]
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built to Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Central to NATO's warfighting concept, integrating various domains and capabilities

### Traditional Joint Operations

- **Position:** Lower on the value chain compared to MDO [0.45, 0.80]
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (evolving towards 0.65)
- **Strategic Significance:** Foundation for MDO, but becoming less relevant as warfare evolves

### Cognitive Domain

- **Position:** Lowest on the value chain among domains [0.40, 0.45]
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis to Custom-built (evolving towards 0.60)
- **Strategic Significance:** Emerging area of focus, crucial for future warfare

### AI-Assisted Decision Support

- **Position:** Low on value chain but high potential [0.30, 0.55]
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis to Custom-built (evolving towards 0.50)
- **Strategic Significance:** Key enabler for advanced decision-making in MDO
