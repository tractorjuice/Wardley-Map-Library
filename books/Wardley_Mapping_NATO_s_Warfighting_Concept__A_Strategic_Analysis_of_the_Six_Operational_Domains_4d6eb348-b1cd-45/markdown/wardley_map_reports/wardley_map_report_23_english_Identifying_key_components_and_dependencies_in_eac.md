## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the key components and dependencies within NATO's Warfighting Concept (NWCC) across six operational domains. It showcases the interrelationships between various military elements, from physical assets to doctrinal concepts.

**Anchor:** The anchor of this map is 'Military Operations', positioned at the top of the value chain. This represents the ultimate user need and the focal point around which all other components are organized.

## Component Analysis

### Military Operations

- **Position:** Top-right quadrant, indicating high value and high visibility
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Central to the entire system, driving all other components

### Physical Assets

- **Position:** Upper-middle, indicating high value but less visibility than operations
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for executing operations, but potentially commoditizing

### Technological Systems

- **Position:** Upper-middle, slightly right of center
- **Evolution Stage:** Transitioning from product to commodity
- **Strategic Significance:** Increasingly important for modern warfare, rapidly evolving

### Human Resources

- **Position:** Upper-middle, left of center
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Essential for operations, but facing challenges in recruitment and retention

### Doctrinal Elements

- **Position:** Lower-middle, indicating lower visibility but still significant value
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built to product
- **Strategic Significance:** Crucial for guiding operations, but needs continuous adaptation

### Environmental Factors

- **Position:** Upper-left quadrant, indicating high uncertainty
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis
