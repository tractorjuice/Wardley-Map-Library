## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the complex geopolitical landscape between NATO and Russia across various operational domains, including land, maritime, air, space, cyber, and cognitive.

**Anchor:** The anchor appears to be the 'Geopolitical Landscape', which serves as the central point from which all other components stem, representing the overarching context of NATO-Russia tensions.

## Component Analysis

### Geopolitical Landscape

- **Position:** High value, medium certainty
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Central to all strategic decisions and actions in the NATO-Russia dynamic

### Cognitive Domain

- **Position:** High value, high uncertainty
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis
- **Strategic Significance:** Emerging as a critical battleground for information warfare and influence operations

### Multi-domain Operations

- **Position:** High value, high uncertainty
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis/Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Key to integrating capabilities across all domains for strategic advantage

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a diverse range of evolutionary stages across domains, with traditional domains (land, maritime, air) being more evolved, while newer domains (space, cyber, cognitive) are in earlier stages of evolution.
