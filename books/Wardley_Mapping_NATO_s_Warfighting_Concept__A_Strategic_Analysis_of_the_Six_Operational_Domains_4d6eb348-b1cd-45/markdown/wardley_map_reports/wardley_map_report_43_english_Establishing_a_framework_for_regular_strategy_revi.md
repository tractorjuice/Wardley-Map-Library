## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the components and relationships involved in establishing a framework for regular strategy reviews within NATO's warfighting concept. It encompasses various elements from the strategic task force to environmental factors and operational domains.

**Anchor:** The anchor is 'NATO NWCC' (NATO's Warfighting Concept), positioned at [0.85, 0.95]. This represents the ultimate user need and the driving force behind the entire strategic review framework.

## Component Analysis

### Strategy Review Task Force

- **Position:** [0.65, 0.85] - Visible and custom-built
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Central to coordinating and executing the strategy review process

### Wardley Mapping Protocol

- **Position:** [0.45, 0.65] - In the product/rental phase with inertia
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for visualizing and analyzing strategic landscapes, but facing resistance to change

### Cross-domain Analysis

- **Position:** [0.48, 0.55] - Transitioning from product to commodity
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (approaching commodity)
- **Strategic Significance:** Essential for understanding interactions between different operational domains

### Cognitive Domain

- **Position:** [0.40, 0.45] - Least evolved among operational domains
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built (approaching product)
- **Strategic Significance:** Emerging area of focus with potential for significant strategic impact

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a mix of evolving components, with some traditional elements (like operational domains) in more mature stages, while newer concepts (like the Cognitive Domain) are less evolved. The Wardley Mapping Protocol and Environmental Scanning show inertia, indicating resistance to change.

### Key Evolving Components
- Wardley Mapping Protocol
- Wargaming and Simulation
- Cross-domain Analysis

### Disruption Risks
- Cognitive Domain
- Cyber Domain
- Space Domain

## Value Chain Analysis

Value flows from the environmental factors through the Strategy Review Task Force, utilizing various analytical tools and methodologies to inform the NATO NWCC.

### Critical Paths
- Environmental Scanning -> Strategy Review Task Force -> NATO NWCC
- Cross-domain Analysis -> Strategy Review Task Force -> NATO NWCC

### Bottlenecks
- Wardley Mapping Protocol (due to inertia)
- Environmental Scanning (due to inertia)

## Strategic Positioning

The framework is well-structured with a clear hierarchy from environmental inputs to strategic output. However, the positioning of some components suggests potential for optimization.

### Misalignments
- Wardley Mapping Protocol (could be more evolved)
- Cognitive Domain (underdeveloped compared to other domains)
