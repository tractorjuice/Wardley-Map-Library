## Map Overview

A comprehensive map showing the organizational components and dependencies required for a successful Windows 11 migration

**Anchor:** User Needs positioned at [0.95, 0.79], representing the primary driver for migration and emphasizing the importance of maintaining service quality during transition

## Component Analysis

### Service Continuity

- **Position:** High visibility, custom-built [0.89, 0.71]
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical bridge between user needs and technical implementation

### Technical Infrastructure

- **Position:** Mid-visibility, product [0.82, 0.45]
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (marked for evolution to 0.89)
- **Strategic Significance:** Foundation for migration success, requires modernization

### Security Controls

- **Position:** Lower visibility, product [0.78, 0.38]
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (marked for evolution to 0.85)
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for risk management and compliance
