## Map Overview

A strategic visualization of the transition from traditional network security to Zero Trust architecture, centered around Windows 11 migration

**Anchor:** Business Operations serves as the anchor, representing the fundamental need for secure and efficient business functionality

## Component Analysis

### Zero Trust Framework

- **Position:** Mid-chain position (0.65, 0.67)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built transitioning to product
- **Strategic Significance:** Central orchestrating component bridging traditional and modern security approaches

### Micro-segmentation

- **Position:** Lower mid-chain (0.45, 0.62)
- **Evolution Stage:** Early product phase
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical enabler for granular security control and Zero Trust implementation

### Traditional Perimeter Security

- **Position:** Genesis position (0.15, 0.38)
- **Evolution Stage:** Marked for evolution
- **Strategic Significance:** Legacy component requiring transformation
