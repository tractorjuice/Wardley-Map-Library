## Phase 1: Foundation Enhancement (Short-term: 2-4 weeks)

### 1.1 Dale-Chall Formula Implementation
**Priority: High | Complexity: Medium**

**Requirements:**
- Obtain Dale-Chall 3,000-word familiar word list
- Implement word lookup functionality
- Add to existing readability analysis pipeline

**Technical Implementation:**
```javascript
class DaleChaIIAnalyzer {
    constructor() {
        this.familiarWords = new Set(/* load from dale-chall-words.json */);
    }
    
    calculateDaleChall(text) {
        // Count unfamiliar words not in the 3,000-word list
        const unfamiliarRatio = this.getUnfamiliarWordRatio(text);
        const avgSentenceLength = this.getAvgSentenceLength(text);
        
        // Raw score formula
        const rawScore = 0.1579 * unfamiliarRatio * 100 + 0.0496 * avgSentenceLength;
        
        // Adjust for grade level
        if (unfamiliarRatio <= 0.05) {
            return Math.max(1, rawScore);
        }
        return rawScore + 3.6365;
    }
}
```

**Files to Modify:**
- `scripts/readability-analyzer.js` - Add Dale-Chall calculation
- `data/dale-chall-words.json` - Word list (needs acquisition)
- `public/readability-analysis.html` - Update UI display

- Academic word list integration (AWL, GSL)
- Domain-specific terminology detection
- Lexical diversity metrics (TTR, MTLD, HD-D)

**Implementation Approach:**
```javascript
class SemanticAnalyzer {
    analyzeVocabulary(text) {
        return {
            lexicalDiversity: this.calculateMTLD(text),
            academicWordRatio: this.getAcademicWords(text),
            domainComplexity: this.analyzeDomainTerms(text),
            frequencyProfile: this.getWordFrequencyDistribution(text)
        };
    }
}
```

## Phase 3: Machine Learning Integration (Long-term: 3-6 months)

### 3.1 Neural Language Model Readability
**Priority: High | Complexity: Very High**

**Approach: Hybrid Implementation**
- Use pre-trained transformer models for perplexity calculation
- Implement lightweight BERT-based classifier
- Ensemble with classic formulas for robustness

**Technical Architecture:**
```javascript
class NeuralReadabilityAnalyzer {
    constructor() {
        // Use TensorFlow.js for client-side inference
        this.model = await tf.loadLayersModel('/models/readability-model.json');
        this.tokenizer = new BertTokenizer();
    }
    
    async analyzePerplexity(text) {
        const tokens = this.tokenizer.tokenize(text);
        const perplexity = await this.calculatePerplexity(tokens);
        return {
            perplexity: perplexity,
            predictedGradeLevel: this.perplexityToGrade(perplexity),
            confidence: this.getConfidenceScore(perplexity)
        };
    }
}
```

**Implementation Options:**
1. **Client-side TensorFlow.js**: Real-time analysis, privacy-preserving
